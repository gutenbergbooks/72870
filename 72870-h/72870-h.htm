<small>MID SILENT SNOWS</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Yes</span>, an extremely pretty girl,” remarked old
Dr. Feng, bending towards me and speaking softly
across the <i>table-à-deux</i> at which we were dining at
the Kürhaus hotel at Mürren, high-up in the snow-clad
Alps. “A honeymooning couple, no doubt,”
he went on—“nice place this for a honeymoon!”
and the white-haired old Chinese who—most unusual
in one of his race, had a long white beard—smiled
as he poured out a tiny glass of white curaçao,
the only form of alcohol I ever saw him indulge in.</p>

<p>I glanced across in the direction he indicated
and saw seated in a corner, a pretty dark-haired
grey-eyed girl of twenty. She wore a flame-colored
dance-frock, and was laughing happily as
she chatted with a good-looking young man, perhaps
six years or so her senior. The young fellow was
smart and distinguished-looking and the girl was
very handsome, with irregular features, and singularly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
expressive eyes, but hers was a nervous, restless
physiognomy that rather chilled one at first sight.
The expression in both their faces told the truth
quite clearly. They were, indeed, newly wed, and
they had that evening arrived on the funicular railway
from Lauterbrunnen, in the valley below, by
the service which had left Victoria station the previous
afternoon.</p>

<p>“Yes, a very handsome pair,” I agreed. “I wonder
who they are?”</p>

<p>“Don’t inquire. When you marry, Yelverton,
you won’t like people to be inquisitive. All newly-married
people are super-sensitive, you know,” declared
my companion.</p>

<p>Dr. Feng Tsu’tong, despite his seventy years,
did not look a day more than sixty. Much above
the common height for a Chinese he possessed features
of the type which seldom show many signs
of advancing age. Erect and virile he carried himself
like a much younger man and of his activity and
endurance I had had ample proof, for, in our frequent
long tramps and ski expeditions across the
snow, he had shown me more than once that his
muscles were equal to my own, despite the great
disparity in our ages.</p>

<p>He was a highly-cultured and widely read man. I
imagined when I first met him, as I found to be the
case when I knew him better, that he must have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
left China many years before, for he spoke perfect
English, though with a slight American accent.
His quaint philosophy had made an instant
appeal to me. Though he was much older than I,
his mental outlook was surprisingly young and we
had become constant companions and very firm
friends in quite a short time. I have seldom met a
man in whom I felt such complete confidence and
sympathy as in this old Chinese doctor. We spent
much time together, often taking long expeditions
afoot or on ski or sometimes as partners in a game
of curling of which he was passionately fond.</p>

<p>Our acquaintance as a matter of fact had been a
casual one. I had left London blanketed under
fog and rain and after a twenty-four hours’ journey
by rail had found myself in Mürren—that winter
paradise of the young, opposite the towering Jungfrau
with its attendant heights, the Monch and
the Eiger, high-up in a glittering world of sunshine,
snow and silence. The scene looked almost
like a typical Christmas card. We were so high
up that by day the sun shone brightly from a sky
as blue and cloudless as that of Cannes, there were
ten feet of powdery snow everywhere and the crystal-clear
air was as bright and invigorating as champagne.</p>

<p>Giacomo, the smiling head waiter, had placed me
with Dr. Feng at a small table set in the window in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
the great <i>salle à manger</i>. We had taken to each
other at once and had become companions, not only
at meals, but on the superb ice-rink which was in
perfect condition as was flooded and re-frozen each
night. There we skated or curled, or we took excursions
on the wonderful rack-railway up to the Allmendhubel,
or else over the snow to what is known
as the Half-way House, or else down to the
Blumen-tal.</p>

<p>Mürren in winter is <i>par excellence</i> a sports centre
for young people who indulge in skating, tobogganing,
<i>lugeing</i> and skiing, the winter sports that are,
in these post-war days, happily eclipsing the exotic
pleasures one obtains on the Riviera. There, in
the Bernese Oberland, the vice of gambling hardly
exists save in the form of occasional bridge as a
relaxation after the day’s sport.</p>

<p>Each winter the Kürhaus hotel is a centre for
the ever-growing band of enthusiasts who meet there
for the bright social life and superb out-door sport
which Mürren affords. These are the people who
truly enjoy themselves healthfully. Skiing and similar
pursuits demand perfect physical fitness and at
the Kürhaus one is in the centre of wholesome out-door
exercise by day and in the evening of a gay
merriment which only seems to round off and complete
the pleasures of days spent in the open air
on the towering mountain slopes. At Mürren one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
finds a winter life that cannot be excelled in Europe.</p>

<p>The scene was wonderfully attractive. All around
us were the great hills clothed in virgin snow, dotted
here and there with merry parties of girls whose
bright sports costumes provided startling splashes
of color against the white background. Everywhere
pretty lips laughed in the sheer joy of young
exuberant life. Everywhere merry conversation
rang out from dawn to dusk, everybody seemed to
be active, healthy and happy.</p>

<p>But beneath all the fun and frivolling I had found
a deeper, more serious note. It was struck for me
by Dr. Feng.</p>

<p>More and more I found myself falling under the
spell of the old man’s mentality. More and more
I realized how much we had in common. A native
of Yunnan, he had left China when about thirty—chiefly,
I gathered, on account of political troubles.
The range and variety of his knowledge was encyclopædic:
there seemed to be hardly a subject on
which he could not talk brilliantly if he chose to
exert himself. And we had one great bond of sympathy—both
of us loved music. Feng was a brilliant
pianist. I was passionately devoted to the violin
and we spent many hours over the works of the
great composers. Like most other young men I
had a fairly good opinion of myself, but compared
with Dr. Feng, I was a mere child in musical knowledge.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
Our music, however, made us both popular
and it had become quite a regular evening custom
for us to play to the Kürhaus guests in the great
ball-room.</p>

<p>There was, however, a still deeper side to our
intercourse. Feng had initiated me into the first
principles of the little-known Yogi philosophy—the
doctrine that the real man is not the visible body,
that the immortal “I,” of which each human being is
conscious to a greater or lesser extent, merely occupies
and uses the corporal transient flesh. The
Yogis believe that the body is but as a suit of clothes
which the Spirit puts on and off from time to time,
and they insist that the body must be brought under
the perfect control of the mind—that the instrument
must be finely tuned so as to respond to the touch
of the hand of the master.</p>

<p>Feng had made a deep study of the Yogi teaching
and was, in himself, living evidence of a man
virile and rejuvenated in both body and mind.
People stood astounded when they were told his
actual age, and I, admiring him, was now endeavoring
in my own way to follow his footsteps. The
doctrine he urged with such compelling eloquence
and powers had taken a deep hold of my mind—how
deep I never realized until I found myself
flung suddenly into dangers and temptations which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
were to try my physical and mental fortitude to
their very depths.</p>

<p>It was the arrival of Stanley Audley and his bride
that, suddenly and unexpectedly, changed the entire
current of my life. And as I sit here placing on
record this chronicle of bewildering events, I wonder
that I came safely through the maze of doubt,
mystery and peril in which I found myself so suddenly
plunged. I can only believe that a man, profoundly
influenced, as I very speedily was, by the
splendid philosophy of Yogi and buoyed up by a
consuming love for a pure and beautiful woman,
will face dangers before which others might well
quail,—will even, as the saying goes, “throw dice
with the devil” if need be.</p>

<p>To make my story clear, I had better formally
introduce myself. My name is Rex Yelverton, my
age at present moment twenty-eight and the astounding
incidents I am about to relate happened
just over three years ago, so that I was under twenty-five
at the time.</p>

<p>My father had died when I was twenty-three
and had left me a small estate near Andover. I
had been brought up to the law and had been admitted
a solicitor just before my father’s death. I
could not afford to live on the estate, so had cosy
chambers on the top floor of an old-fashioned house
in Russell Square and having entered into partnership<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
with a solicitor named Hensman, practiced
with him in Bedford Row.</p>

<p>Hensman’s hobby was golf and for that reason
he took his holiday in the summer. I loved the
winter life of Switzerland and for some years had
made it my rule to get away in the winter. In addition
to my music I was deeply interested in wireless,
and had fitted up quite a respectable wireless
station in a room in Russell Square. I had a transmitting
license and with my two hobbies found my
spare time so fully occupied that I mixed but little
in ordinary society.</p>

<p>On that never-to-be-forgotten night when I first
saw Stanley Audley and his handsome bride, the
Doctor retired early, as was his habit. So, strolling
into the ball-room of the Kürhaus opposite the hotel,
I watched the pair dancing happily together, the
cynosure of all eyes, of course, though the room was
not very full, as the season had only just begun.</p>

<p>Like all other honeymoon couples, they were trying
to pretend that they had been married for years
and, like all other honeymoon couples, they were
failing lamentably! The truth was, as ever, palpable
to every onlooker. Like every one else I admired
them, though like every one else, I smiled at
their pretty pretense. As they had arrived by the
night train from Calais, I guessed they had been
married in London about thirty hours before and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
had come straight through to Mürren. This, in
fact, proved to be the truth.</p>

<p>In my admiration of the beautiful young bride
I was not alone, for a middle-aged, grey-bearded
invalid, name Hartley Humphreys, with whom I
often played billiards before going to bed, also
remarked upon her beauty, and expressed wonder
as to who they were. It was then that another man
in the room, also evidently interested, told us that
their name was Audley.</p>

<p>Next morning, on coming downstairs, I found
little Mrs. Audley dressed in winter-sports clothes
and looking inexpressibly sweet and charming.</p>

<p>She wore a pale grey Fair Isle jersey, with a
bright jazzy pattern, with a saucy little cap to match,
and over the jersey a short dark brown coat with
fur collar and cuffs, and around her waist a leather
belt. Brown corduroy breeches, and heavy well-oiled
boots and ski-anklets completed one of the
most sensible ski-outfits I have ever seen. That she
was no novice at skiing was evident from the badge,
a pair of crossed skis, she wore in her cap. It was
the badge of the Swiss Ski Club—the same as that
worn by the Alpine guides themselves.</p>

<p>Naturally I was surprised. I had, on the previous
night, believed her to be simply a handsome young
bride who had come to spend her honeymoon amid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
the winter gayety of Mürren, but now it was clear
she was no beginner.</p>

<p>She had already breakfasted and was smoking a
cigarette and laughing gayly with an American girl
she had met on the previous night, and apparently
awaiting her husband.</p>

<p>In a few moments the husband, in a wind-proof
ski-suit and wearing one of those peaked caps of
blue serge which nobody dare wear save the practiced
ski-runner, came down with a word of apology.</p>

<p>“I broke my boot-lace, dearest. I apologize.”</p>

<p>“Oh! That’s all right, Stan,” she laughed, “John
has got the food in his rucksack.”</p>

<p>Then I saw that John von Allmen, the intrepid
and popular young guide, was waiting outside for
them. They were going on a skiing excursion up
the Schelthorn. Certainly they were no novices! I
soon afterwards discovered they had both passed
their “tests” in previous winters at Wengen and
Pontresina.</p>

<p>The sun was shining brightly upon the newly
fallen snow, although it was not yet nine o’clock,
and as I watched the happy young couple adjust
the ski-bindings to the boots and take their ski-sticks,
those iron spiked poles of cherry wood with
circular ends of cane to prevent sinking where the
snow is soft, I noted how merry and blissful they
were.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>Suddenly the tall, lithe, young Alpine guide in his
neat blue serge skiing suit drew on his leather mitts,
hitched on his rucksack and the little party slid
swiftly away over the snow.</p>

<p>It was clear the girl was an expert—her every
movement showed it. Those who go skiing well
know the difficulty of keeping their balance on the
long, narrow planks turned up in front which constitute
ski. But the bride had long ago passed
through the initial stages. As I found out later she
had been year after year to winter sports and had
long passed the period when she practiced her “telemarks”
and “stemmings” on the “Nursery Slopes.”
Her lithe swift movements were delightful to watch
and it was clear she was enjoying to the full the
keen exhilaration born of the swift gliding over the
crisp snow.</p>

<p>As I stood watching the swift progress of the
Audleys and their guide, old Dr. Feng spoke
behind me.</p>

<p>“A pretty sight, Yelverton. It is good, indeed, to
be young. There’s an example of the fate lying
before you: you’ll have to marry some day, you
know.”</p>

<p>“No sign of it yet, doctor,” I laughingly replied.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, matrimony had so far made
no appeal to me: I had never met a girl who had
stirred me deeply. I had many friends—or at least<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
acquaintances—of my own sex, but I was deeply
absorbed in my hobbies and, not seeking society
for society’s sake, I had hardly any woman friends.
Sometimes I fancied that the opposite sex found
in me something antipathetic and uncongenial: at
any rate, I made little progress with them and,
perhaps for that reason, was quite content to remain
a bachelor and keep my father’s old housekeeper,
Mrs. Chapman, to “mother” me as she did when
I was a boy and manage my flat in Russell Square.</p>

<p>I suppose I was no better and no worse than
thousands of other fellows of my age. Men coming
down from Oxford and flung into the whirl of London
life are not usually Puritans or ascetics. I
suppose I was much like them. Life was young in
me, and fortune had been kind. If I had few
friends, I had no enemies: I had an income ample
for my wants and I enjoyed myself in my own way.
My work kept me busy during the day: my evenings
were filled with music, my “wireless,” an occasional
dance, or theatre and I was always merry and
happy. Nothing had occurred to make me, a careless
youngster, realize that there was something
in life deeper and dearer than anything I know. I
was not given to self-analysis or overmuch introspection
and that a storm of love might some day
shatter my complacent existence to bits never crossed
my mind. My music and my experiments in radio-telephony<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span> 
were about the only serious side of my
life. So Dr. Feng’s good humored badinage left
me quite unmoved.</p>

<p>We strolled together to the curling rink for a
match.</p>

<p>Old Mr. Humphreys, a grey-faced financier from
the near East, and a very charming and refined old
fellow, sat in his invalid chair watching us. The
ice was in perfect condition and very fast, so that
the game was as good as could be obtained, even
in Scotland itself. The orchestra was playing gay
music for the skaters, some of whom were waltzing,
laughter sounded everywhere and the bright sunny
morning was most enjoyable.</p>

<p>We lost the match, mostly, I fear, through several
very bad stones that I played, and our lack of energy
in sweeping. Curling is a very difficult game to play
well, for, unlike golf or tennis, one can get such
little practice at home.</p>

<p>However, we all afterward retired to the bar,
and over our cocktails old Mr. Humphreys who,
being a confirmed invalid, wheeled himself about
in his chair, chatted merrily. He had arrived about
a week after I had come. He seldom, if ever, left
his chair during the day. His guidance and management
of the chair was wonderful and he could even
play billiards while seated. He and the doctor were
great friends and often joined a bridge party together,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
while I took my skis up the cable railway
to the Allmendhubel and swept back down the slopes.</p>

<p>The following afternoon, while passing along the
terrace of the big chalet which overlooks the rink,
I found Major Harold Burton, here the secretary
of the Mürren Bob-sleigh Club, and at home an
officer in the Tank Corps, chatting with the Audleys.</p>

<p>“I say, Yelverton!” he exclaimed, “will you join
us on a test on the bob-run presently? Mr. and
Mrs. Audley are coming. Let me introduce you.”</p>

<p>I raised my ski-cap and bowed.</p>

<p>“Thanks,” I replied, “I’ll be delighted to make a
fourth. You’re the only man I’d trust to take me
down. It’s too fast for me!” I added with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Is it really a fast run?” asked the bride, smiling.</p>

<p>“Well, you will see for yourself,” I replied.</p>

<p>Laughing gayly we went over the snow, past the
bend at the village shop where one can obtain anything
from a Swiss cuckoo clock, to a paper of pins,
and whose elderly proprietor is one of the best ski
instructors in the canton. Paying our fare, we ascended
by the rack-railway up the snowy heights
of the Allmendhubel.</p>

<p>On the truck was our heavy “bob,” with its steel
frame and runners, and its delicate controls. At
the summit the attendants pushed it along the flat
to the narrow entrance of the bob-run which a hundred
hands had, a few weeks before, constructed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
in the snow, digging it all out and making many
banked-up hair-pin bends down the side of the mountain
for two and a half miles back into Mürren.</p>

<p>Those curves are scientifically calculated for
speed, but it takes an expert to negotiate them successfully.
The crew of a “big bob” must know the
course, and be alert to the command of the driver
to bend over “right,” “left,” or “up.” One’s first
trip in a “bob” on a fast run is an experience never
to be forgotten. But both the bride and bridegroom
revealed that they had done such things before.</p>

<p>At the “gate” of the run—a narrow cut eight
feet deep in the snow—a smiling Swiss stood beside
the telephone, which gave “clear passage.” Burton,
as an expert, who took no chances, had the “bob”
turned over, and examined the brakes and controls,
which sometimes get clogged with snow.</p>

<p>We all got in and set our feet forward on the
rests, I being behind to act as brakesman, and to
“brake” at the instant order of Burton.</p>

<p>“Everybody all right?” he asked, as we settled
ourselves behind each other on the big bob.</p>

<p>We responded that we were, then four men
pushed us off down the narrow icy slope.</p>

<p>Slowly we went at first. Then, suddenly gathering
speed, we saw a dead end in front of us.</p>

<p>“Right!” cried Burton, and all of us leaned over
to the right and thus negotiated the corner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>“Left!” was the order, and round we went every
moment gathering speed.</p>

<p>“Careful!” he cried, “in a minute we shall have
a right and left quickly. Now—! Right! Left!
Up! Quick!”</p>

<p>By this time we were flying down the side of the
mountain, showers of particles of ice every now
and then being thrown up and cutting our faces.
Now and again we swept through clouds of snow.
We held our breath and screwed up our eyes until
we could only just see.</p>

<p>“Left! Right! Up! Left—again! Right!”
shouted Burton, and each of us alert and quick,
obeyed. We were traveling at a furious speed and
any fault might mean a serious accident, such as
that in which one of the British Bob-sleigh team
for the Olympic Sports broke both his legs during
a run at Chamonix.</p>

<p>“Straight!” we heard Burton shout as we flew
along, still down and down. “Right in a few moments,”
he cried. “Be careful. Then a big bump
and we’re down. Steady!—steady! Now-w-w!
Right!—Look out! Bump! Good!” and he steered
us down a straight path past where the watcher
stood at the other end of the telephone.</p>

<p>“Well?” he shouted to the time-keeper, as he
pulled up, “what is it?”</p>

<p>“Four minutes, eight and a half seconds, sir,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
replied the tall, thin-faced Swiss peasant, speaking
in French.</p>

<p>“Good! Fairly fast! But we’ll try to do it in
better time tomorrow.”</p>

<p>I had sat behind little Mrs. Audley who, turning
to me, her face reddened by the rush of frosty air,
exclaimed,—</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it glorious! I’ve been to Switzerland
three times before. I passed my third test in skiing
two years ago, but have never been on a big bob-run.
That last double turn was most exciting,
wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>I agreed, and we all four strolled together back
to the hotel to tea.</p>

<p>Afterward, as I walked in the twilight upon the
snowy path leading to the station of the funicular
railway, I found myself surrounded by groups of
young men and girls returning from skiing on the
Grütsch Alp, and other places. But even these
cheerful greetings and joyous conversations could
not remove from my mind a new and entirely strange
feeling of fascination that I felt was exercised over
me by pretty Mrs. Audley. It was something magnetic,
something indescribable, and, to me, wholly
weird and uncanny. I had only spoken to her a few
casual words. Yet I knew instinctively that into my
careless and care-free life a new and disturbing
element had entered.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<small>A TEMPORARY BRIDE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Though</span> I was not, as a rule, fond of society, it
was impossible to resist the infection of the merry-making
spirit at Mürren and in consequence I joined
heartily in all the fun that was going forward. The
night of the bob-sleigh trip found me playing the
drum in the amateur jazz band—a dance-orchestra
formed among the visitors each year, to carry on
the dancing after midnight. Mrs. Audley and her
husband came into the dance-hall of the Kürhaus
just as the merriment began, and they danced together
while I sat behind the drum with a little
comic, flat-brimmed hat in imitation of George
Robey, upon my head.</p>

<p>“Really your amateur band is more amusing than
the professional one,” declared Audley, during the
interval. “Last night we watched you. It seems
that the visitors wait until you start up.”</p>

<p>“Well,” I laughed. “We try and keep things
humming along until two, or even three o’clock. We
like to play and the others like to dance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>“My wife loves it,” he declared. “She’s only just
been saying that she would like to join you.”</p>

<p>“Right!” I said, laughing. “She shall be our
pianist tomorrow—if she will.”</p>

<p>But the bride hesitated. “I’m afraid, Mr. Yelverton,”
she said, “that I’m not so good as the
American girl you’ve got. She’s a professional,
surely.”</p>

<p>As a matter of fact she was studying the piano
in Paris, and was in Mürren for the winter holiday.</p>

<p>And then we struck up again and the crowd danced
merrily till nearly three o’clock.</p>

<p>The following day was a Saturday. I spent a
large part of the morning gossiping with old Mr.
Humphreys, whose chief pleasures as an invalid
seemed to be to play bridge and to smoke his pipe.
Though his was rather a thoughtful disposition, as
his deep-sunken eyes and shaggy brows suggested,
yet he was always a cheerful and entertaining companion.</p>

<p>“I sometimes stay with my sister at Weybridge,
in Surrey,” he explained, as I walked beside him
while he wheeled his chair over the snowy road
which leads out of the village along the edge of the
deep precipice overlooking Lauterbrunnen in the
misty valley far below. While we were in the bright
keen air high-up above the clouds, with the sun
shining brilliantly over a white picturesque world,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
below, in the valley, it was dark dull winter. “Very
soon,” added my friend, “very soon I’ll have to go
back to Constantinople, where I have a good many
interests. But I shall only be there a few weeks. All
this political trouble makes things very difficult
financially. Have you ever been in Turkey?”</p>

<p>I replied in the negative, but added that it had
long been my desire to go there, and see the beauties
of the Bosphorus.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, “You ought to go. You’d find
lots to interest you. Life in the Turkish capital and
Turkish life is quite different from life in Europe.
The Turk is always a polished gentleman and, moreover,
the foreigner is now better protected in every
way than the Turk himself, thanks to the laws made
years ago.”</p>

<p>“That, I suppose, is why Constantinople before
the war was such a hot-bed of European sharks,
swindlers and bogus concession-hunters,” I remarked,
with a smile, for I had heard much of the
“four-flush” crowd from a friend who had interests
in the Ottoman Empire.</p>

<p>“Exactly,” he laughed. “It is true that in Pera
we have a collection of the very worst crooks in
all Europe. But it is hoped that, under the new
conditions, Turkey will expel them and begin a
new and cleaner regime.”</p>

<p>As he spoke we turned a sharp corner, and Stanley<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
Audley and his pretty wife, smart in another
sports suit of emerald green that I had not before
seen her wearing, shouted simultaneously the warning,
“<i>Achtung!</i>”</p>

<p>Next second, recognizing us, they greeted us
cheerily as they slid swiftly past upon their skis.</p>

<p>“A very charming pair—eh?” remarked old
Humphreys. “The more I see of them the more
interesting they become. What do you think of
the girl? You are young, and should be a critic of
feminine beauty,” he added, with a smile.</p>

<p>“I agree. She is very charming,” I said, “Audley
is, however, rather too serious, don’t you think?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do. She’s too go-ahead for him—she’s
a modern product as they call it. If a man marries
he ought to have a comrade, not a cushion. A
woman, to be a perfect wife, should not be too intellectual.
A knowledge of literature, art and science
does not necessarily make for domestic happiness.
In a wife you want heart more than brains.
Yet a giddy, brainless wife is even a worse
abomination.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean Mrs. Audley,” I asked.</p>

<p>“Not in the least,” he replied quickly. “I don’t
think she is either brainless or giddy. I am only
giving you my idea of the perfect wife. The real
wife would be a <i>mate</i>—the term is used by the lower
classes and expresses the ideal perfectly. It sums up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
the whole thing. And I don’t think Mr. and Mrs.
Audley are really <i>mated</i>, though at present they are
evidently very much in love with one another. I
think they married in a hurry.”</p>

<p>This was a new line of thought for me, and, naturally,
I was astonished. But I kept silence. Old
Humphreys had seen far more of the world than I
had and I had a good deal of respect for his
judgment.</p>

<p>When we got back to the hotel Dr. Feng was
waiting for me and we went in to lunch together.
We were late and the big dining room was almost
empty. After we had finished our meal Feng went
to his room and I strolled into the lounge intending
to have a cup of coffee there and then go to my
room to write some letters.</p>

<p>To my surprise—for I thought they were out skiing—I
found Audley and his wife seated on a settee.
Both were obviously upset and the bride’s eyes
showed unmistakable traces of tears.</p>

<p>To this day I cannot imagine what prompted me,
but I think it must have been sheer nervous bravado
for, without passing, I stepped across to them, and
with a laugh exclaimed,—</p>

<p>“Well—and what is the matter now?”</p>

<p>Both stared at me in natural resentment. I could
have bitten my tongue out in my vexation at having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
perpetrated such a banality. I started a stumbling
apology.</p>

<p>“Oh, all right, Yelverton,” said Audley, his resentment
vanishing, “the fact is we are in a difficulty
and I don’t quite know what to do.”</p>

<p>“Can I help you anyhow?” I asked.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not. But I’ll tell you how things are.
We were married in London only four days ago
and now I have to go back and Thelma doesn’t like
it. I’m an electrical engineer at the head offices in
Westminster of Gordon &amp; Austin, the big combine
which holds concessions for the supply of electricity
to about forty towns in England. I’ve just had a
wire calling me to attend a meeting of the directors
on Monday morning. It is proposed to promote me
to be manager of the power works at Woolwich,
which means a big lift that will be a great thing for
me in the future.”</p>

<p>“Well, of course, you’ll go,” I said.</p>

<p>“I suppose I must,” he replied. “But according
to the papers there’s a big gale in the Channel and
only the little boat is crossing from Boulogne.
Thelma doesn’t want me to leave her and she is
such a bad sailor that if she came with me she would
certainly be very seriously ill. The last time she
was seasick she collapsed very dangerously. She
cannot possibly make the crossing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>The girl was obviously on the edge of a flood of
tears.</p>

<p>“But surely,” I said to her husband, “Mrs. Audley
will be all right here for a few days. If you care
to trust me so far I shall be delighted to look after
her and so, I am sure, will Dr. Feng and Mr.
Humphreys. She could be with us. You ought
to be back by Wednesday evening.”</p>

<p>“It’s awfully kind of you, Yelverton,” said Audley,
“but it rather looks like taking advantage of
your good nature.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” I said, “we shall all be delighted.
If you catch the Boulogne express from Interlaken
tonight you will be in Victoria tomorrow evening
in good time for your appointment on Monday.
You can leave again on Tuesday and be up here on
Wednesday. We will keep Mrs. Audley amused
until then.”</p>

<p>Both expressed their thanks and we went to the
telephone to get on to the Sleeping-car Company
in Interlaken and reserve a berth.</p>

<p>I arranged to leave with them at four o’clock
that afternoon and descend by the funicular into
Lauterbrunnen, where Audley would take train for
Interlaken to catch the night-mail for Boulogne.</p>

<p>Thus, having fixed things up, I left them and went
up to the Doctor’s room where I told him what had
occurred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>The old fellow at first laughed immoderately and
declared I was extremely foolish to intrude. However,
he was sympathetic enough.</p>

<p>“Poor little girl!” he said. “Of course she would
be very lonely. We must have her to sit at our table,
Yelverton, and of course, my dear boy, you must
entertain her. Poor little girl!—she has only one
honeymoon, and to think that it should be so interrupted!
Yes. You did quite the right thing,—quite
right!”</p>

<p>At six o’clock I stood on the snowy platform at
Lauterbrunnen station with “The Little Lady,” as
I called her, and we watched her husband wave
us farewell as the train left. It was dark, damp and
dreary down there. A thaw had set in and it was
sloppy under foot. Lauterbrunnen is not a pleasant
place in winter. Suddenly she turned to me and
with a merry laugh exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Yelverton, I suppose I am now your
temporary bride—eh?”</p>

<p>We laughed together, and then crossed back to
the little station of the funicular railway and slowly
ascended until, just in time for dinner, we were back
again in Mürren.</p>

<p>Naturally, the fun-loving guests at the hotel made
the best of the news that Stanley Audley had had to
dash off to London and had left his pretty wife in
my charge. Chaff and banter flew freely, practical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
jokes were played on us by the score and the excitement
helped to chase away Mrs. Audley’s depression.
And, perhaps, wisely, she sought to get rid
of her natural sorrow by flinging herself into the
whirl of the Kürhaus life. She danced, laughed and
even flirted mildly with one or two young fellows in
a way she certainly would not have dreamed of doing
had Stanley Audley been present. But it was all
very innocent and above-board and not even the
strictest moralist would have found fault with this
gay abandon which, I fancy, was half assumed. For,
disguise it how she would, she was quite clearly devoted
to her husband and longed only for his return.</p>

<p>Next day she lunched with Dr. Feng and myself
and in the afternoon we put on our skis and I took
her out over the snow to the Grütsch Alp by a way
which commanded a magnificent view of the high
Bernese Alps. We took our cameras with us and,
on my table, as I write there is a snap-shot I took of
her as, in her smart winter sports kit, she sped
swiftly down a steep slope with her ski-sticks held
behind her in real professional style.</p>

<p>She proved a delightful companion. She was, I
found, a Londoner born and bred, and she had all
the genuine shrewdness and good humor of the
town girl. She was well educated, a perfect encyclopædia
of books and plays, and she was, as I knew,
a splendid dancer. Her mother, the widow of an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
ex-naval officer named Shaylor, lived at Bexhill. Of
her father she remembered very little: he had been
on the China Station for many years and his visits
home had been infrequent. He had died in China
the year before.</p>

<p>The humor of my position struck me forcibly.
Here was I, a young bachelor fairly well off and
sufficiently good-looking, left in charge of a beautiful
young girl who was a bride of only a few days!
In England, of course, such a position would have
been unthinkable. It did not seem so strange in the
free and easy camaraderie of Mürren where the free
and easy sporting life bred a harmless unconventionality
and where even the British starchy reserve was
very early sloughed off. Everybody made a joke
of the whole affair and Dr. Feng and old Mr.
Humphreys laughed like boys at this novel status I
had acquired.</p>

<p>Of course there was some malice: there always
is in a mixed company. After we had glided some
miles across the snow, we halted and I poured out
some tea from the vacuum flask I carried. Just as
Mrs. Audley was drinking a party of men and girls
from the hotel passed. Noticing us, one of the
girls made some remark. What it was I did not
hear, but it produced a burst of ill-mannered laughter
and my companion turned scarlet.</p>

<p>“They’re horrid, aren’t they?” she said and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
agreed. “But it is really delightful here,” she said,
looking up into my face. “You are most awfully
kind to us, Mr. Yelverton. Stanley and I shall
never forget it. If he gets the position of manager
at Woolwich it will mean so much to us—and it
will greatly please my mother.”</p>

<p>“Was your mother—er—against your marriage?”
I inquired.</p>

<p>“Well—yes, she was. She thought I was too
young. You see I’m not nineteen yet, though people
think I’m older,” she confessed with a charming
little moue. “Stanley is an awfully good boy, and I
love him so very much.”</p>

<p>“Naturally, and I hope you always will,” I said.
“Of course, I’m older than you, but our position here
today is really a bit unconventional, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“It is,” she laughed, “I wonder how you like being
bothered with a temporary bride?”</p>

<p>“I’m not bothered, but most charmed to have
such a delightful companion as yourself, Mrs. Audley,”
I declared.</p>

<p>We returned to dinner after an enjoyable afternoon
amid those wild mountains and snowy paths,
and when she came to table she provided one of us,
at any rate, with a startling surprise.</p>

<p>We had taken our seats at our table and were
waiting for her. Seated with my back to the door
I did not see her enter the room, but I saw Dr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
Feng, who was facing me, suddenly stiffen in his
chair and not even his Chinese impassivity could disguise
the look of amazement, almost of fear, which
leaped suddenly into his eyes.</p>

<p>“Whatever is the matter, doctor?” I jerked out
in amazement.</p>

<p>Instantly the old man had himself in hand again.
But that glimpse of his vivid emotion had startled
me. Before I could say anything he had risen and
was greeting Thelma Audley. I sprang to my feet.</p>

<p>Mrs. Audley was wearing a dainty gown of ivory
silk—her wedding dress, she told us later, put on
in compliment to the old doctor. She looked very
sweet and girlish in it. But Dr. Feng, I could
plainly see, had no eyes for the dress: his attention
was concentrated on the extraordinary pendant
which Mrs. Audley wore on her bosom, suspended
from a thin platinum chain round her neck.</p>

<p>“Look what I have had sent me!” she cried as she
called our attention to it. “Did you ever see anything
so quaint?” And she took it off and handed
it to the doctor. He took it from her with what,
had the brooch been some sacred emblem, I should
have thought was an expression of deep reverence,
and examined it closely.</p>

<p>It was a sufficiently striking ornament to have
attracted attention anywhere. It was fashioned in
the form of a peacock’s foot, about three inches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
long. The shank, at the end of which was a tiny
ring through which the platinum chain was passed,
was of rough gold studded with small diamonds
and each of the claws was composed of a single
crystal, cut to the natural shape of the claw. The
jewels blazed in the glare of the electric lights. The
pendant was of exquisite workmanship and was quite
obviously enormously valuable.</p>

<p>“Why, wherever did you get that, Mrs. Audley?”
I exclaimed. “It’s really wonderful.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it pretty?” she said. “It came by registered
post this evening and I found it waiting for
me when I went up to dress. Mother had sent it
on from Bexhill. I don’t know who sent it—there
was no letter—but perhaps I shall find out when I
get home.” It was evident she had not the least
idea of the value of this quaint jewel.</p>

<p>I was keenly watching Dr. Feng. For some reason
I could not explain, I connected the crystal claw
with the unmistakable agitation he had shown as
he caught sight of Mrs. Audley entering the room.</p>

<p>“Did you say there was no letter with it? Perhaps
you have kept the packing,” he asked, gravely
regarding the jewel as it lay in the palm of his hand.</p>

<p>“Oh, it came from some foreign place,” Mrs.
Audley said. “I could not make out the name, but
I will fetch the wrapper, perhaps you can tell,” and
she darted from her seat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>Feng sat silent, turning the claw over and over
in his hand and closely examining it. He seemed to
have forgotten me entirely in his abstraction.</p>

<p>A few moments later Mrs. Audley returned with
a small box and some peculiar paper in which it had
been wrapped. The whole had been rewrapped
in brown paper in England and the original address—“Miss
Thelma Shaylor, care of Mrs. Shaylor,
Bexhill-on-Sea, Sussex, England,” was undamaged.
It was a queer cramped handwriting, evidently that
of a foreigner.</p>

<p>Dr. Feng glanced at it. “This was posted in
Pekin,” he said, “Have you any friends out there,
Mrs. Audley?”</p>

<p>“No, certainly not,” was the startling reply. “I
have never known anyone in China. Are you sure
it is from Pekin?”</p>

<p>Dr. Feng smiled. “You forget I am a Chinese,
Mrs. Audley,” he said. “You can be quite sure that
package came from Pekin. It is wrapped in Chinese
rice paper as you will see, and the address was
written by a Chinese.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Audley looked puzzled. “Well,” she said
at last, “someone who knows me must have gone
to China. But it’s very pretty, and I wish I knew
who sent it.”</p>

<p>“You must take great care of it,” said Dr. Feng.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
“It is very valuable, apart from sentimental considerations.”</p>

<p>Then our talk drifted to other topics and the crystal
claw, for the moment, was apparently forgotten.
But I noticed that Dr. Feng could not keep his eyes
off it for long, and he was unusually silent and
abstracted during the meal.</p>

<p>Tired from her ski excursion Mrs. Audley left us
early and went to bed. The old doctor and I were
sitting in the lounge drinking coffee when I made up
my mind to ask him about the crystal claw.</p>

<p>“What does the crystal claw mean, Doctor?” I
said quietly, shooting the question at him suddenly
in an interval of our chat.</p>

<p>He glanced at me keenly. “What do you mean?”
he asked. “What makes you think I know anything
about it?”</p>

<p>“All right, Doctor,” I laughed. “I happened to
be looking at you when Mrs. Audley came into the
dining room and saw your face. Also I saw you
looking at the claw afterward. Don’t tell me you
don’t know anything about it. Remember I’m a
lawyer.”</p>

<p>The old man laughed. “You’re right enough, my
boy,” he said pleasantly. “I know a good deal
about the crystal claw. But what I don’t know is
why it was sent Mrs. Audley—or rather to Miss
Shaylor.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>“Same thing, isn’t it?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Not by any means,” he rejoined quickly. “That
claw was sent to Miss Shaylor—to Miss Shaylor,”
he repeated emphatically. “The fact that she is
Mrs. Audley has nothing whatever to do with it.
She thinks it is a wedding present. It is nothing of
the kind. The man who sent her the crystal claw
could not have known of her wedding, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Tell me all about it, Doctor,” I begged.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said slowly, “I don’t suppose it will do
any harm if I do. But you had better keep what
I tell you to yourself, at any rate for the present.</p>

<p>“The crystal claw,” he went on, “is the badge or
sign of the Thu-tseng, a powerful Manchu secret
society. There is nothing illegal about the society;
it simply works for the political regeneration of
China. Hsi-yuan himself is one of its leading lights—you
know of him, of course. The claw is given,
so far as outsiders are concerned, only to those
who have rendered some signal service to the society.
Now, I cannot see how Mrs. Audley, by any conceivable
stretch of the imagination, can have helped
the Thu-tseng. Excepting myself, she has probably
never spoken to a Chinese in her life.”</p>

<p>“Did you know her father was a naval officer
and was for many years on the China Station?” I
asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>Feng started violently, “Is that so?” he asked
quickly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” I replied, “she told me so only today.”</p>

<p>The old man sank back into his chair and pondered
deeply.</p>

<p>“That may explain it,” he said slowly. “It is just
possible the claw has been sent to her in recognition
of something her father did. But, if so, it must have
been something of very great importance. How
long has her father been dead?”</p>

<p>“About a year,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, after another period of thought,
“there must have been some reason why the sending
of the claw was delayed. But,” he went on with
growing animation, “you can take it from me she has
powerful friends. With that claw in her possession
she could ask almost anything she liked in any part
of China today. It would be a magic talisman
there.”</p>

<p>Of course, I was as completely bewildered and
amazed as Dr. Feng. But I could only assume that
his solution of the mystery was correct. Mrs. Audley
apparently knew next to nothing of her father’s
life abroad: certainly she would and could know
nothing of his political activities there. But Feng
was confident he had somehow been associated with
powerful members of the Thu-tseng.</p>

<p>“I will send some cables tomorrow,” he said, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
we parted for the night. “I am deeply interested in
this affair. China is the land of mysteries, and this
is beyond me. The last time I saw the crystal claw
was when I was in Tibet twenty years ago. It was
worn by a monk of a Buddhist monastery there.
But, of course, I could never find out why he got it.”</p>

<small>THE DEADLY FOEHN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Next</span> day, while old Humphreys remained in his
invalid chair to write some business letters to his
agents in the Near East, and Doctor Feng had a
match at curling, I took “The Little Lady” out upon
the other side of the deep valley to the popular winter
sports resort at Wengen, which lies up the
mountain on the opposite side of the valley. We
lunched at the splendid Regina Hotel, where every
one goes, and afterwards took some snap-shots.
Later we took the train up to the Schiedegg and came
down on our skis, a glorious run back to Wengen,
the snow conditions being perfect. In everything
she was interested, admiring the scenery and thoroughly
enjoying the run, until we returned in the
darkness up the mountain side again to Mürren.</p>

<p>I had come to the conclusion that Mrs. Audley
had been a London business girl, for she told me she
knew shorthand and typewriting, and she was
evidently familiar with business affairs. The old invalid
had become even more interested in her. He
studied her as the type of the modern girl and she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
certainly was always bright and vivacious when with
us. Dr. Feng, however, though he was invariably
polite to her, seemed to have become, for some reason,
decidedly antagonistic. It is true the position
was decidedly unconventional and irregular, but I
could not reconcile his present attitude with his
earlier and very obvious liking for Mrs. Audley. He
now disagreed utterly with my quixotic offer to look
after her and did not hesitate to say so.</p>

<p>“You are playing with fire,” he declared. “You
are both young and she is a very pretty girl. The
best thing you can do will be to clear out.”</p>

<p>I laughed, of course, and told him I had only
accepted this responsibility in order to help a man
out of a difficulty.</p>

<p>He shook his head. “You don’t know either of
them, and you don’t know what you may have let
yourself in for.”</p>

<p>I wondered, naturally, whether he had been influenced
by the arrival of the crystal claw, and asked
him bluntly if this were the case.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” he assured me. “The crystal claw
has nothing whatever to do with it.”</p>

<p>In spite of all he said I would not take his advice.
In the headstrong way of youth I put him down as a
thoroughly conventional old fogey, a survival of the
Victorian era when girls were compelled to go about
with chaperons and the smoking of a cigarette was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
a vice to be indulged only in the strictest privacy.
So Mrs. Audley and I continued to enjoy ourselves,
skating each morning on the rink and skiing together
in the afternoon over the freshly fallen snow.</p>

<p>With a view to throwing additional light on the
mystery of the crystal claw I tried as delicately as I
could to “pump” her about her father. But it was
evident she knew little or nothing beyond what she
had told me. “He was a naval officer on the China
Station for many years,” seemed to sum it all up and
I wondered whether, for some reason I could not
divine, further knowledge had been deliberately
withheld from her. Of Eastern political affairs she
obviously knew nothing.</p>

<p>Of her husband she said little, though I saw she
was devoted to him.</p>

<p>“When we get back, Stanley and I hope to get a
flat at Hampstead,” she said one day when we were
resting after a swift run on skis close to the Half-way
House—which is on the electric railway line
which runs from Mürren along the edge of the
precipice, before one changes into the rack-railway
to descend to the valley.</p>

<p>That night at dinner there was a strange incident.
Mrs. Audley came down in a gown which was the
envy of many girls in the hotel. It was made of ciré
tissue, and the yoke and hem were of silver lace.
The front panel was ornamented with pin tucks and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
finished with a chou of flowers. It was a charming
frock. On her breast the crystal claw winked and
blazed in the light of the lamps.</p>

<p>Old Humphreys, contrary to his usual custom,
had come into the dining room for dinner and was
seated in his wheeled chair at the same table as Mrs.
Audley, Dr. Feng and myself.</p>

<p>I shall never forget the look that came over his
face when he caught sight of the crystal claw!
Rage, fear and amazement mingled together until
the old man looked positively demoniacal. Luckily,
Mrs. Audley was talking to Dr. Feng and neither of
them noticed him.</p>

<p>It was a moment or two before the old invalid
could control himself. Then his face resumed its
usual expression. But I had caught a glimpse of the
hell that, for a brief moment, must have raged in
the old man’s mind and once again the crystal claw
seemed to be associated with something sinister and
dangerous.</p>

<p>“That’s a pretty new brooch you have, Mrs. Audley,”
said the old fellow in a grating voice which
showed that even now he had hardly recovered
himself.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she laughed merrily, “isn’t it sweet? It
came by post, sent to me from Pekin. I haven’t any
idea who sent it for there was no name. It has been
forwarded from London, and is no doubt a wedding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
present from somebody who has forgotten to enclose
a card.” And she turned over the crystal claw
so that he could admire it.</p>

<p>Afterwards we crossed the snowy road to the
Kürhaus, where in the spacious ball-room we danced
together. She also danced with two or three other
admiring partners. Old Mr. Humphreys wheeled
his chair into the dancing room as was his habit each
evening. It was pathetic to see the grey-haired thin-faced
man who seemed so active in every other sense,
deprived of the power of locomotion. When he left
his chair he managed to hobble along and with great
difficulty up the stairs with the aid of rubber-capped
sticks. Mostly, however, the porters carried his
chair upstairs to the first floor and he wheeled himself
along the corridor to his room.</p>

<p>On the following morning, according to arrangements
made over-night, we started at nine o’clock
and taking with us John, the smart, ever-smiling
guide, we started out on our skis to ascend the
Schwarzbirg, nine thousand feet high, by way of the
Bielen-Lücke. The ascent we found extremely interesting,
but the weather, even when we started,
was grey and threatening. Now and then snow
clouds drifted quickly across, and that dangerous and
mysterious Alpine wind, the Foehn, ever and anon
grew gusty. It was clear a storm was threatening.</p>

<p>“A little blizzard, perhaps,” remarked the slim,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
agile John, in his soft English, as he slid along over
the snow.</p>

<p>Weather conditions in the Alps change with every
moment. A blizzard may succeed brilliant sunshine
within five minutes—a blizzard that whips the face
with its icy blast, piles snow deep, and freezes one
to the marrow. In the glacier regions of the higher
Alps, the weather cannot be depended upon for a
few minutes together.</p>

<p>Thelma, that day, wore the ski kit in which I had
first seen her—the Fair Isle jazzy patterned jersey,
and over it the short little wind-proof jacket
trimmed with fur, and her corduroy breeches and
stockings. It was in every way serviceable.</p>

<p>Presently when she had, to my surprise, executed
what is known as an “open Christiania,” and we
were skiing together across a great plateau of snow
far above the tree-line, with John fifty yards ahead
of us, she suddenly exclaimed—</p>

<p>“Do you know, Mr. Yelverton, I’ve heard nothing
from Stanley except a telegram sent from Victoria
at six o’clock on Sunday night, announcing his
arrival. I’ve wired, but I’ve got no reply. I’m
worried about him, but I don’t want to bother you.”</p>

<p>“That’s curious,” I remarked. “To where have
you sent your wire?”</p>

<p>“To his office in Westminster.”</p>

<p>“Well, you ought to have had a reply. But never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
mind,” I said. “He’s due back tomorrow night.
We’ll go down to Lauterbrunnen and meet him—eh?”</p>

<p>The sky had suddenly become darkened and a
strong tearing wind had sprung up. We had left the
plateau and upon our skis were following John
“herring-boning” up the side of the mountain.
When one starts “herring-boning” one faces the incline
and points the skis outwards at a considerable
angle to each other—then the slope can be mounted
by lifting the skis forward alternately and placing
them in the snow on the inner edges, the angle between
them remaining the same.</p>

<p>It was a steep slope, so we made wider angles between
our skis to prevent them slipping backwards.</p>

<p>We were lurching heavily from side to side in
order to throw the weight of one ski while lifting the
other, when John suddenly shrieked the warning,
“<i>Achtung!</i>”</p>

<p>Next second I heard a soft hissing sound overhead,
then a loud rumbling which increased to thunder.
I instinctively seized Mrs. Audley. The next
moment we were struck violently in the back, covered
by a blanket of snow, and hurled down the
mountain side amid an avalanche of snow, stones
and rocks.</p>

<p>When, very slowly, I awakened to a sense of
things about me, I found I had bitten my tongue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
badly and felt a severe pain at the back of my skull
where, I suppose, I must have struck a rock. Mrs.
Audley was still in my arms and unconscious, her
bleeding face white as marble. Both of us were
deeply imbedded in the snow, but our heads fortunately
lay clear, otherwise we must certainly have
been suffocated. The avalanche had swept us down,
but as I had instinctively grasped my dainty companion,
we had been held together.</p>

<p>Blood was flowing freely from the wound in my
head, and Mrs. Audley’s face was cut and bleeding.
As quickly as possible I disengaged myself from the
heavy weight of snow upon me, and strove to rouse
her from her swoon. The thought that she might be
dead drove me well-nigh frantic.</p>

<p>I seized her by the shoulders and shook her violently.
Then with trembling fingers I tore open her
jacket, jersey and silk blouse, and bent my head to
listen. Her heart was beating faintly.</p>

<p>My vacuum flask of hot tea was battered and
broken but in an inside pocket I had, providentially,
a small flask of brandy which was undamaged. I
forced a few drops of the spirit between her pallid
lips.</p>

<p>Her lips moved. A moment later she opened her
big grey eyes and asked me in a whisper:</p>

<p>“Where am I?”</p>

<p>“You are safe,” I assured her, holding her in my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
arms. “Don’t worry. We’ll be out of this very
soon.”</p>

<p>“But where are we?” she asked gazing around
upon the snowy surroundings. “Where is John?
Tell me!”</p>

<p>I told her briefly what had happened.</p>

<p>“But where is John?” she queried. “I hope he is
all right. It was very foolish for us to venture up
here after the warm Foehn of yesterday,—wasn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“I expect John is all right,” I said. “He warned
us, and no doubt took precautions.” Guides in the
Alps seldom fail.</p>

<p>With difficulty we wriggled out of the snow and
stood up. Even in our shaken condition we could
not but admire the panorama of the Eiger, the Jungfrau
and the Wetterhorn, across the darkening valley
before us. But haste was imperative: the light
was fading quickly and we were a long way from
Mürren.</p>

<p>I had lost one of my skis, which had been torn
from its strong Huitfeldt binding in our fall. Mrs.
Audley’s, however, were intact, and we started to
descend. She soon recovered in the keen Alpine air,
and was able to help me, lame dog that I was. Repeatedly
we gave the six shouts recognized as the
regular Alpine distress call, but there was no reply.</p>

<p>It was quite dark when we struggled back, to find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
that our guide, having happily escaped, had arrived
before us and sent out a search-party. By shouts
and flashing signals, this was soon recalled.</p>

<p>At the hotel they put Thelma to bed at once, while
after the Swiss doctor had seen to my head, I sat
in the bar recounting my experience and drinking a
strong whiskey and soda.</p>

<p>Dr. Feng and Humphreys were both most eager
to know the details of our adventure. But later the
doctor said—</p>

<p>“I think you are very foolish, Yelverton! You
ought never to have had anything to do with the
bride, she will only bring trouble upon you. Humphreys
agrees with me. You’re a young fool!”</p>

<p>“Probably I am,” I replied laughing! “I very
nearly lost my life over it today.”</p>

<p>“You are a regular Don Quixote,” he said.
“Well, I admire you after all. You would be a fine
young fellow, if you were just a little more
cautious.”</p>

<p>“Cautious!” I laughed, facing the old doctor,
“I’m young. You are old. You weren’t cautious
when you were my age, were you?”</p>

<p>“No,” he answered. “I suppose not—I suppose
not.”</p>

<p>The night-mail train from Boulogne arrives at
the little station at Lauterbrunnen each evening
about five o’clock. The next afternoon therefore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
Mrs. Audley, who had quite recovered from her
accident on the previous day, accompanied me down
into the valley by the cable railway. She was all excitement,
for her husband, before his departure, had
promised to return by that train, and had, indeed,
booked his sleeping-berth by it.</p>

<p>At last the train came slowly in from Interlaken,
where the change is made from the <i>wagon-lit</i>. A
number of hurrying English visitors descended but
Stanley Audley was not among them.</p>

<p>Bitter disappointment was written upon the girl’s
face.</p>

<p>“He must have missed the train at Victoria,” she
declared.</p>

<p>“Well,” I said, “There is not another through
train until tomorrow—unless he travels by Paris
and Bâle.”</p>

<p>The station master, however, informed us that
the service from Paris would not arrive till early
next morning, so that we were compelled to reascend
to Mürren.</p>

<p>Audley’s failure to telegraph or write to his wife,
struck me as uncommonly strange.</p>

<p>While we were in the narrow little compartment
of the cable railway, I ventured to put several questions
to her concerning him. But she would give
only evasive replies.</p>

<p>Next day she went to the little wood-built post office<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span> 
alone and despatched several telegrams to
various addresses, but the replies she received gave
no news of her husband. Evening came again, but
Stanley Audley was not among the arrivals from
London, though I was with Thelma on the arrival
of the mountain train at Mürren station.</p>

<p>“I cannot make it out,” she said as we sped back
to the hotel on our skis. “Surely he must be delayed.
Perhaps he has telegraphed to me and the message
has gone astray!”</p>

<p>“That may be,” I agreed in order to reassure her,
but personally I felt much mystified.</p>

<p>Next day I telegraphed to the managing director
of Gordon &amp; Austin, the electrical engineers in
George Street, Westminster, asking for news of
Stanley Audley, and in response about five o’clock
in the evening came a reply which read: “Stanley
Audley is not employed by us and is unknown to us.”</p>

<p>I said nothing to Thelma, but finding Dr. Feng
alone, showed him the telegram.</p>

<p>The old doctor grunted with dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>“Something wrong somewhere,” he remarked.
“One should always be very careful of hotel acquaintances.
I warned you at the time that you were
indiscreet to offer to look after the bride of a man
you don’t know.”</p>

<p>“I admit that! But the whole affair is very mysterious.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
He told me a deliberate lie when he said
he was employed by Gordon &amp; Austin.”</p>

<p>“Yes. He’s a mystery, and evidently not what
he pretended to be. What does his wife think?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t shown her the telegram.”</p>

<p>“Don’t. Try and discover what you can from
her.”</p>

<p>“You don’t seem to like her, Doctor,” I said
bluntly.</p>

<p>“No. I don’t like either of them,” the old man
admitted. “There’s too much mystery about the pair.
I was discussing them with Humphreys this morning,
and he agrees.”</p>

<p>“It is not Thelma’s fault,” I said.</p>

<p>“It may be. She evidently knows more about her
husband than what she has told you.”</p>

<p>“Well, she’s told me nothing,” I replied.</p>

<p>“There you are! She is concealing the truth. Go
and find out all you can. And don’t be indiscreet.
Your present position is dangerous. Perhaps he’s
left her deliberately and palmed her off upon you,
hoping that you will both fall in love, and he can
free himself of her at your expense. Such things are
not unknown, remember!”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it,” I declared. “I undertook a
trust—foolishly if you like—and it is up to me to
carry it out to the best of my ability.”</p>

<p>“Ah! my dear boy, your eyes are closed very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
often,” the old doctor said. “The lookers-on see
most of the game, and I’ve seen one or two little
things which show that your temporary bride is not
adverse to a little secret flirtation.”</p>

<p>“How?” I asked quickly.</p>

<p>“Well, she’s on quite friendly terms with that
young fellow, Harold Ruthen.”</p>

<p>“Ruthen!” I echoed. “I didn’t know they were
acquainted. I’ve never seen them speak.”</p>

<p>“No, not when you are about,” replied the old
man laughing. “But I’ve often seen them chatting
together.”</p>

<p>This surprised me. Harold Ruthen was a rather
foppish, fair-haired man about my own age, whose
airs were of the superior type. His interest in
Thelma had not escaped me, but I had never seen
them speaking together. He was, I understood, an
ex-officer, and he was a very good skater. But at
first sight I had taken an instinctive dislike to him
and, that he should have made Thelma’s acquaintance
in secret, greatly annoyed me.</p>

<p>I felt myself responsible to Stanley Audley, even
if he had deceived me.</p>

<p>Now I found myself in a difficulty. Only at that
moment I recollected how, on the morning before
Thelma’s husband had announced his forced return
to London, I had seen Ruthen walking with the
doctor up a narrow path with high snow-banks close<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
to the hotel. They were deep in conversation, and
old Feng seemed to be impressing some point upon
Ruthen while he listened very attentively.</p>

<p>Did Dr. Feng know more than he admitted?</p>

<p>I must say that I did not like his hostile attitude
towards the newly wedded pair, an attitude which
now seemed to be shared by old Mr. Humphreys.</p>

<p>That night, when Thelma came to table, she was
wearing a charming gown of almond green, that
we had not seen before. Though she looked beautiful,
her face was more serious than usual, and I suspected
that I saw traces of tears.</p>

<p>As we sat together I fell to wondering who was
Stanley Audley? Why had he deceived his young
wife, and then deserted her, leaving her in my
charge?</p>

<p>Had I fallen into a clever trap?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>WHISPERS OF WOMEN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Two</span> days passed, yet Stanley Audley did not return.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the second day, old Mr.
Humphreys spoke to me in confidence while we sat
at tea, which is almost a religious ceremony in
Mürren.</p>

<p>“Funny about that young fellow Audley,” he said.
“Have you discovered anything further?”</p>

<p>“No,” I replied, “the fact is I don’t like to be too
inquisitive.”</p>

<p>“Of course, but the girl is left in your charge, and
you certainly have a right to know the truth,” declared
the old invalid. “Personally, I don’t like the
situation at all. I shall go back to London in a few
days, but do let me know how you get on, for I am
interested. You can always write to me, care of the
Ottoman Bank in London.”</p>

<p>I promised, and finding Thelma, who had just
come in from the rink, where there had been an
ice-hockey match, I greeted her in the hall as she
went downstairs to tea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>Later we went for a stroll together and as we
passed out into the grey twilight, young Ruthen held
open the door for us, bowing, but not speaking.
Before me the pair posed as strangers.</p>

<p>“I don’t like that fellow!” I remarked, as we
walked along the snowy road out of the village.</p>

<p>“Neither do I,” was her quick response.</p>

<p>“But, if I’m not mistaken, Mrs. Audley, you are
acquainted with him,” I remarked.</p>

<p>“Well—yes—and no,” she said. “It is true that
he thrusts himself upon me whenever he has the
chance, and your back is turned. I’ve snubbed him a
dozen times, but he is always lurking about.”</p>

<p>“Then you are not friendly with him?”</p>

<p>“On the contrary. I confess I don’t like him,”
she answered quite frankly. Whereupon I resolved
to try and catch him speaking with her and tell
him what I thought of him.</p>

<p>“He’s a cad!” I declared. “He pretends to be a
gentleman, but he does not behave like one.”</p>

<p>“You speak as though you are annoyed, Mr. Yelverton,”
and she laughed lightly.</p>

<p>“I am. You are left in my care, Mrs. Audley.
Your husband would be very angry if he knew that
the fellow pestered you with his unwanted attentions,
would he not?”</p>

<p>“I suppose he would,” she faltered.</p>

<p>“I wonder why we hear nothing from Stanley?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
I said. “It is all very mysterious. Do you know
that he is not employed by that electrical firm in
Westminster? They know nothing of him!”</p>

<p>She halted, held her breath and stared at me.</p>

<p>“What!” she cried. “But surely he is at Gordon
&amp; Austin’s? I left him at their offices one day just
before our marriage and he went in there.”</p>

<p>“They know nothing of him,” I assured her, telling
her of their reply to my inquiry.</p>

<p>“I really can’t believe it,” she said in a voice of
despair. “Stanley could not have lied to me like
that.”</p>

<p>“Have you ever met his parents?”</p>

<p>“No. They are in India—at Lucknow.”</p>

<p>“But what do you know about him? Where did
he live before you married him?”</p>

<p>“He had rooms in Half Moon Street. I went
there once or twice,” and she told me the number.</p>

<p>“How long had you known him before you married?”
I inquired.</p>

<p>“About six months, but he was mostly away in
Paris, on business for his firm.”</p>

<p>“That is the story he told you, but it is now
proved to be incorrect. The firm have no knowledge
of him.”</p>

<p>“There must be some mistake,” she said, much
puzzled.</p>

<p>“Did you introduce him to your mother?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>“Yes, he came home to Bexhill once and stayed
the week-end at the Sackville. Mother liked him
awfully, but at the same time she thought I was too
young to marry.”</p>

<p>“Then during the time of your engagement he
was mostly away—eh? Did you ever meet any of
his relatives?”</p>

<p>“No,” she replied—rather hesitatingly. I thought
then she endeavored to change the topic of our conversation.</p>

<p>I, however, pursued it. A suspicion forced itself
on my mind that she really knew a good deal more
than she would tell me. But though I persisted for
some time she would tell me nothing more and
naturally I began to be annoyed. I did not wish to
think hardly of her, but it was impossible to stifle
entirely the suspicions that insisted on forcing themselves
upon my mind. Had I been caught in some
carefully prepared trap or had I merely made a
colossal fool of myself?</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, my companion, bursting into
tears she could no longer control, blurted out—</p>

<p>“I’ve been foolish, Mr. Yelverton—so very foolish!
The fact is I—I’ve married a man—a man—<i>I
did not know</i>!”</p>

<p>“Did not know,” I gasped in turn. “Is that really
the truth?”</p>

<p>“It is,” she said sobbing. “I—I believed all that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
he told me, but now I have found out that what he
said was false. And—and already he has deserted
me!”</p>

<p>“But you love him,” I said, full of sympathy for
her in her obviously genuine distress. “Perhaps,
after all, we are misjudging him. Something has
occurred which prevents his return. I will wire at
once to Half Moon Street and see whether we can
get any news.”</p>

<p>“Yes, do,” she urged. “Mr. Belton is the man
who keeps the chambers. I recollect the name.”</p>

<p>So we turned back to the chalet post office whence
I sent a reply-paid telegram. Next evening came
the answer. “Mr. Audley left for abroad about
two months ago—Belton.”</p>

<p>That was all. We had at least one person who
knew him and who might place us in possession of
more facts than we had at present.</p>

<p>After dinner that night Dr. Feng asked me to go
with him to his room.</p>

<p>“I have had some telegrams from China,” he said,
when he had established me comfortably in an easy
chair with a whiskey and soda at my hand.</p>

<p>“Any news about Thelma?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied: “it’s a very curious story. Of
course, I have no details and I am afraid we shall
never get any. But there is enough information to
show, as I expected, that the crystal claw was sent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
to Mrs. Audley in recognition of services rendered
by her father to a powerful member of the Thu-tseng.
Have you ever heard of Sung-tchun?”</p>

<p>I nodded. “Wasn’t he the chap who escaped
from Siberia under rather extraordinary circumstances
in the early years of the war—about 1916
or 1917? There was a lot about him in the papers,
I remember, but I never saw any reason given for
his imprisonment.”</p>

<p>“No public explanation ever was given,” said Dr.
Feng, “but, as a matter of fact, he was arrested on
Russian territory north of China on a trumped-up
charge. As a matter of fact his party stood in the
way of certain Russian ambitions in China and he
was quietly removed. Incidentally I can tell you
that after his escape the Russian government paid
very handsome compensation and apologized. But
all that was kept private.</p>

<p>“Now the interest to us is this: Sung-tchun’s
escape was planned and directed, from start to finish,
by Mrs. Audley’s father. Of course, he was not
actively engaged in the actual rescue: he could not
leave his ship. But he organized and financed the
whole thing. Sung-tchun was a really important
figure in China—far more important than the outside
world realized—and to have done them such a
service would have been ample to earn the undying
gratitude of the Thu-tseng, who never forget a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
friend or a foe. That is all the information my
friends can get, and I fancy it is all we shall ever get.
What Captain Shaylor’s motive was and how he was
dragged into or embarked upon the affair and where
he obtained the huge sums of money the rescue must
have cost, we shall never know.”</p>

<p>“But why,” I cried, “has the crystal claw only just
arrived? Thelma’s father died over a year ago.”</p>

<p>“That is one of the questions I asked,” replied
Dr. Feng. “Sung-tchun died only last year and I
imagine he must have kept very closely the secret
of his escape. In all probability the sending of the
claw was a kind of death-bed gift from him to the
man who had helped him—or rather to his daughter.
That would be quite in accordance with Sung-tchun’s
known character.”</p>

<p>“Then the crystal claw does not imply a threat or
any danger?” I exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” declared Dr. Feng. “It is an
expression of the very utmost good will. Any member
of the Thu-tseng would be bound by the most
solemn obligation to help in every way in his power
the owner of the crystal claw.”</p>

<p>“Well,” I said as I rose to say good-night, “at
any rate, I am glad there is no danger about it.
But I don’t see how the Thu-tseng can ever help
Thelma.”</p>

<p>Old Feng gave me a queer look. “You can never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
tell,” he said slowly. “Most people want help
badly at some time in their lives. Mrs. Audley, for
instance, is in a position of considerable difficulty at
the moment and may be in a worse one very soon.
And remember this, my boy—the Thu-tseng has an
arm longer than you dream of.”</p>

<p>As the days slipped by I became more and more
concerned about Thelma. Feng’s antagonism to herself
and her husband became daily more apparent,
and I was glad when, the day after old Humphreys
had departed, he left for London. However, we
parted good friends. He was going to London first
and then to the Riviera and he gave me his solicitor’s
address so that I might write to him.</p>

<p>Before he left I mentioned to him the effect the
sight of the crystal claw had had on old Humphreys.
“Does <i>he</i> know all about the crystal claw?” I asked,
half banteringly.</p>

<p>Feng was not even mildly interested. “He spent
some years in China, I know,” he remarked indifferently,
“but I fancy you must have been mistaken.
All his interests were in trade and finance—not in
politics. Probably what you took for an expression
of rage and fear was the result of the terrible spasms
of pain that seize him occasionally.”</p>

<p>The explanation seemed so reasonable that I accepted
it without hesitation. After all, it was extremely
unlikely that old Humphreys could have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
been mixed up with the Thu-tseng and Feng, I
thought, could hardly have been so unmoved had he
really thought there was anything in my suspicions.</p>

<p>But I was to learn months later that the astute
Chinese had completely hoodwinked me. I had
made no mistake at all. The information I had
given him was to prove of supreme importance in
the game Dr. Feng was playing, so we learned when
the final move had been played. The man must have
had nerves of iron. He was off his guard when the
crystal claw arrived, it is true, but the news—of
tremendous import, as events showed—that Humphrey’s
had good reason to fear the Thu-tseng did not
cause even the quiver of an eyelash. There are few
things in nature so utterly impassive as the face of
the cultured Chinese!</p>

<p>Thelma passed day after day in tense anxiety for
news of Stanley. To fill time we made frequent skiing
excursions to the Schelthorn or the <i>Seeling furen</i>
but every evening at half-past five we were at the
little shed-like station, breathlessly awaiting the
train bringing up travelers from England.</p>

<p>And each evening we hurried away disappointed.</p>

<p>In the hotel, on the ski-fields, and on the bob-run
the fun was fast and furious, but the laughter and
the dance music jarred upon the nerves of both of
us. And, to make matters worse, many visitors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
were beginning to look askance at Thelma, now that
young Audley did not return.</p>

<p>Questions were asked of Thelma on all sides, and
to them she was compelled to give evasive, and
sometimes, untrue, answers.</p>

<p>Ten days after young Audley should have returned,
I had, late at night, left the ball-room at
the Kürhaus opposite the hotel after a couple of
hours of strenuous drumming in the jazz orchestra.</p>

<p>Thelma had retired early, and, though in no mood
for gaiety, I had been compelled to help my brother
amateur bandsmen. So at two o’clock we had closed
down and the dancers were all crossing the snowy
road back to the hotel.</p>

<p>The moon was shining brilliantly over the towering
glaciers, transforming the silent snow-clad mountains
and forests into a veritable fairyland. Such a
clear, frosty night was inviting for a stroll and many
couples wrapped in coats had put on their “gouties”—or
snow-shoes—and were going for walks before
turning in.</p>

<p>I turned into the hotel gardens where the trees
were heavily laden with freshly fallen snow, and
entered a path where the snow was piled six feet on
either side. My footsteps fell noiselessly on the
fresh snow and suddenly I heard voices in the path
that ran parallel with mine—the voices of a man and
a woman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>Instantly I recognized the woman’s voice as
Thelma’s and I stood in surprise that she should be
out of doors at such an hour.</p>

<p>“Now, for the last time I ask you, Thelma, where
Stanley is,” I heard a man’s voice say. “You had a
telegram from him today. Where is he? I want
to see him very urgently.”</p>

<p>The voice, beyond any possibility of mistake was
Ruthen’s. Thelma had assured me she disliked him,
that he pestered her with unwelcome attentions.
Yet here she was talking to him at two o’clock in
the morning, three hours after she had said good-night
and, apparently, gone to bed!</p>

<p>“I tell you it is no business of yours,” came her
reply in a hard, resolute voice. “He is my husband
and if he tells me to keep silence I shall do so.”</p>

<p>“Then you refuse to let me see the wire?” he
asked. “I arranged ten days ago that I should know
if you received a telegram. It was delivered to your
room at five o’clock tonight—and you know where
Stanley is, though to everybody, including that fool
Yelverton, you pretend ignorance and shed crocodile’s
tears!”</p>

<p>“Oh! let me get back,” cried the girl. “I won’t
be insulted! Mr. Yelverton does not know the
truth, but he is at least kind and considerate towards
me.”</p>

<p>“And takes Stanley’s place in your heart—eh?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
the fellow sneered. “Now, I ask you once again if
you will tell me where I can find Stanley. Every
hour is of the greatest importance to both of us. If
you tell me, then your husband may be saved, after
all!”</p>

<p>“Mr. Ruthen, if I could trust you, I would reply.
But I don’t!” was her plain answer.</p>

<p>I held my breath as I listened to that strange conversation.</p>

<p>“But surely you know me well enough, Thelma, to
know that I am acting only in your interest! Yelverton
is a very good fellow, but happily he is in
ignorance, and his devotion to his duty as your
guardian makes it all the easier for us. Now, don’t
be a little fool. Where can I get into communication
with Stanley?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I refuse to tell you!” replied the girl. “I know
a little more than you think, and I would rather trust
Stanley than you—even though I have to make pretence
of ignorance to Mr. Yelverton.”</p>

<p>“To fool him, you mean!” laughed the man
superciliously.</p>

<p>“Well, and if I have to fool him, it is for my benefit,
not yours,” she said defiantly.</p>

<p>“And suppose I told him all that I know?” said
Ruthen. “I know that he is your admirer—that
Stanley ought never to have left you in his charge,
and—well it is patent to everybody that you are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
fonder of Rex Yelverton than of your newly-married
husband.”</p>

<p>“How dare you say such a thing!” she cried in
fierce anger.</p>

<p>“Because it is true, my dear young lady,” was the
cool reply. “I did not come out here for nothing.
Stanley has disappeared, and this afternoon you
had a telegram from him telling you, in secret, of
his hiding-place. I want to know it!”</p>

<p>“And I refuse to tell you. He has cut himself
adrift from you forever.”</p>

<p>The man laughed jeeringly.</p>

<p>“That would be more difficult than you imagine,”
he said. “You are treading upon very dangerous
ground now, Thelma. Tell me what I want to
know, and I will help both Stanley and yourself.
You must know he is in serious danger.”</p>

<p>“I refuse!” she said. “I will not betray Stanley.”</p>

<p>“Betray him! It is not a case of betrayal. He is
already betrayed. It is a matter of saving him.”</p>

<p>“From what?”</p>

<p>“You know. Don’t pretend ignorance, my dear
Thelma! Surely we know each other well enough to
be friends when Stan’s safety is concerned! He
doesn’t know I’m here in Mürren, or he would have
wired me his whereabouts, so that I could go straight
to him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>I listened amazed to this extraordinary conversation.
I had never dreamed that the tall fair-haired
young man who posed as a stranger to my temporary
bride, was, after all, an intimate friend of her husband’s.</p>

<p>“Remember,” he went on. “Yelverton is highly
inquisitive—and very naturally. He has been bamboozled
from the very first. I wonder he hasn’t
smelt a rat long ago. But, of course, he is your admirer.
But we can’t waste time—we’ve been out
here too long now. Tell me where I can find
Stanley.”</p>

<p>“I refuse,” was her firmly repeated reply.</p>

<p>“In that case I shall act as I have already warned
you.”</p>

<p>“I do not intend that you should meet him again.
I know sufficient concerning your friendship—too
much indeed,” she said determinedly. “I am not
blind to the fact that you are my enemy and
Stanley’s. He has hidden himself from his enemies,
of whom you are one, and it is not likely I shall tell
you,” she added.</p>

<p>“Very well, then—take the consequences. I shall
tell what I know,” the man said.</p>

<p>“In which case I shall also tell what I know—which,
I venture to think you will find a trifle awkward
for yourself. <i>So think it over</i>,” she said defiantly
in a low clear voice. “Good-night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>Her footsteps were muffled in the soft snow as she
made her way back to the hotel, alone. Ruthen followed
a few minutes later: no one would have
guessed that they had been out together.</p>

<p>I went to my room more puzzled than ever.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

<small>ESTABLISHES SOME CURIOUS FACTS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I met Thelma next morning I noticed that
she was pale and obviously nervous and ill at ease. I
longed to question her, but to do so would have been
to reveal the fact that—unintentionally, it was true—I
had been eavesdropping.</p>

<p>It was now plain that the man Ruthen, whom I
had thought to be a mere hotel acquaintance of Stanley
Audley’s, was, in truth, something more, whether
friend or enemy I was still not quite sure. Thelma’s
attitude, it was true, suggested the latter, though
Ruthen had professed friendly motives. His attitude
towards her thoroughly incensed me. But I
realized that there must be some reason, unknown to
me, why Thelma never acknowledged him when I
was present. It was evident too that she hated and
possibly feared him and that she, at any rate, regarded
him as her husband’s enemy.</p>

<p>She made no mention of the telegram from her
husband that Ruthen had referred to and, as she had
not denied having received it, I assumed that
Ruthen’s information was correct. It might have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
been, of course, a reassuring message, but if this was
so there was no apparent reason why she should not
have told me about it and her obvious anxiety and
nervousness seemed entirely to contradict the suggestion
that it could have contained any good news.</p>

<p>That morning we took our skis up the cable railway
to the Allmendhubel, a thousand feet further up
the mountain side, and thoroughly enjoyed our sport
on the steep snowy incline above the village. A ski-jumping
competition had been arranged for the afternoon
and we spent an hour watching the competitors
“herring-boning” and “side-stepping” as they
climbed over the snow up the distant heights in
readiness for the swift descent ending with the high
jump that only experts can accomplish.</p>

<p>Thelma seemed silent and <i>distraite</i> all the morning.
At length I asked her what was troubling her.</p>

<p>“I really didn’t know I was glum!” she replied.
“Forgive me, Mr. Yelverton, won’t you? I am awfully
worried about Stanley. I really think it is useless
for me to remain here in Mürren any longer. I
had better go home to Bexhill.”</p>

<p>The suggestion seemed to confirm my suspicion
that she knew her husband’s whereabouts, and felt it
useless to await any longer for him.</p>

<p>“My time is growing short, too,” I said. “I fear
I must be back at my office on Monday. My partner
writes that he is very busy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>“Then you will go on Saturday—the day after
tomorrow, I suppose? If so—may I travel with
you?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” I said. And as she had not booked a
sleeping-berth on the Interlaken-Boulogne express,
I promised that I would see after it during the afternoon.</p>

<p>Later that day I found that Audley had left her
with only about a hundred francs, and she was compelled
to allow me to settle her hotel bill.</p>

<p>As we came up into the hall after dinner the concierge
handed Thelma a note, saying—“Mr. Ruthen
has left, miss, and he asked me to give you this!”</p>

<p>She held it in her hand for a second, and then,
after glancing at me, moved away and tore it open.</p>

<p>The words she read had an extraordinary effect
upon her. Her face went as white as the paper, and
she held her breath, her eyes staring straight before
her. Then she crushed the flimsy paper in her hand.</p>

<p>She reeled against a small table, and would have
fallen had she not, with a supreme effort, recovered
herself, and quickly stood erect again.</p>

<p>“Forgive me, Mr. Yelverton,” she managed to
ejaculate. “I’m not feeling very well. Excuse me,
I—I’ll go to my room!”</p>

<p>And she turned and ascended the stairs, leaving
me astonished and mystified.</p>

<p>What, I wondered, did that farewell note contain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>I saw her no more till next day. She sent me a
message by the chambermaid to say that she was not
coming down again and I passed the evening gossiping
with Major Burton and two other “bobbing”
enthusiasts.</p>

<p>By this time I had pretty thoroughly wearied of
the eternal round of pleasure. Thelma’s obvious
distress and the extraordinary mystery into which I
had stumbled occupied all my thoughts and I could
no longer take the slightest pleasure in the gay life
which seethed and bubbled around me. It was therefore
with a feeling of genuine relief that I found
myself at last in the restaurant car of the Boulogne
express, slowly leaving Interlaken for the long
night run across France by way of Delle and Rheims.
Already we had left behind us the crisp clear air of
the mountains. The snow everywhere was half
melted and slushy and the train pushed its way onward
through a dense curtain of driving sleet.</p>

<p>We ate our dinner amid a gay crowd of holiday
makers returning, not only from Mürren but from
Grindelwald, Wengen, Adelboden, Kandersteg, and
other winter sports centres. The talk was gay and
animated, merry laughter resounded through the
long car. Yet Thelma sat pale, silent and nervous
and her tired eyes told their own tale of sleeplessness
and anxiety. She gave me the impression that she
had been crushed by some sudden and unexpected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
shock and though more than once I fancied she was
on the edge of confiding in me, she remained almost
dumb and was clearly disinclined to talk.</p>

<p>We arrived at Victoria on Sunday afternoon and
I drove with her in a taxi to Charing Cross. On the
way she suddenly seized my hand and looking
straight into my eyes said—</p>

<p>“I really do not know how to thank you, Mr. Yelverton,
for all your great kindness towards me. I
know I have been a source of great worry to you—but—but—”
she burst into tears without concluding
the sentence.</p>

<p>I drew her towards me and strove to comfort her,
declaring that I would continue to act as her friend
and leave no stone unturned in my efforts to trace
Stanley.</p>

<p>At last, as we went down the Mall, she dried her
eyes and became more tranquil. We were approaching
the terminus whence she was to travel to Bexhill.</p>

<p>“Now—tell me truthfully,” I said to her at last,
“do you, or do you not, know where Stanley is?”</p>

<p>She started, her lips parted, and she held her
breath.</p>

<p>“I—I deceived you once, Mr. Yelverton. I—I
did once know where he was. But I do not now.”</p>

<p>“Then you wish me to discover him?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Yes. But—but, I fear you will never succeed.
He can never return to me—<i>never</i>!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>“Never return to you? Why? Was he already
married?” I gasped.</p>

<p>“No. Not that. Not that! I love Stanley, but
he can never come back to me.”</p>

<p>The taxi had stopped, and a porter had already
opened the door. I asked her to explain, but she
only shook her head in silence.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, I grasped her hand in farewell,
and she waved to me as the train moved off to the
pleasant little south-coast resort where her mother
was living. Thelma Audley’s was surely a sad
home-going.</p>

<p>Back in my rooms high-up in gray and smoky
Russell Square, I found old Mrs. Chapman, with her
pleasant face and white hair, had prepared everything
for my comfort. The night was cold and
rainy, and the London atmosphere altogether depressing
and unpleasant after that bright crisp
climate of the high Alps.</p>

<p>I looked through a number of letters which had
not been sent on and, after a wash, ate my dinner,
Mrs. Chapman standing near and gossiping with me
the while. My room was warm and cozy, and with
the familiar old silhouettes and caricatures upon its
walls, the side-board with some of the Georgian
plate belonging to my grandfather, and a blazing
fire, had that air of homelike comfort, which is always
refreshing after hotel life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>After I had had my coffee, and my trusted old
servant had disappeared, I threw myself into my big
arm chair to think over the amazing tangle in which
I had allowed myself to become involved.</p>

<p>Was I falling in love with Thelma—falling in
love foolishly and hopelessly with a girl who was
already married? I tried hard to persuade myself
that my feeling towards her was nothing but a deep
and honest affection, born of her sweet disposition
and the queer circumstances that had thrown us together.
Stanley Audley, whatever the explanation
of his amazing conduct might be, had trusted me
and I fought hard in my own mind against a temptation
which I realized would, in normal circumstances,
be a gross betrayal of confidence. I had been
brought up in a public school where “to play the
game” was the one rule of conduct that mattered
and hitherto I had prided myself on my punctiliousness
in all the ordinary matters of life. Was I to
fail utterly in the first great temptation that life had
brought me?</p>

<p>I could not disguise from myself, try how I would,
that even an honest admiration for Thelma had its
perils. As Dr. Feng had said, it was dangerous.
We were both young. I had hitherto escaped heart-whole,
Thelma was not only more than ordinarily
beautiful but she possessed a degree of charm and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
fascination—for me, at any rate—that was well-nigh
irresistible.</p>

<p>For a long time I paced my room in indecision.
To act as Dr. Feng had suggested would be to break
off our acquaintanceship, treating it merely as the
passing incident of a pleasant holiday. But that, I
argued, was impossible. I had promised Audley to
look after his wife when everything seemed plain
and straightforward: to desert her now when she
was clearly in difficulty and distress was unthinkable.
Yet to go on might—probably would—spell utter
disaster to my peace of mind, and make shipwreck
of my honor.</p>

<p>Hour after hour passed and I seemed to draw no
nearer to a conclusion. But at length the glimmerings
of a solution of the problem began to draw in
my mind. If I could but find Stanley Audley I could
cut myself adrift from the mystery and try to forget
Thelma as speedily as possible. This I determined
honestly to try to do, and I think I felt better and
happier for the resolution. What I failed to realize
was the strength of the feelings that had me in their
grip. And ever and anon, like an inducement of
hope, came the resolution of Thelma’s declaration
that Stanley could never return to her. In that case—but
I resolutely tried to push away from me the
thoughts that crowded into my mind.</p>

<p>Next day, after spending a couple of hours at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
Bedford Row with my partner, Hensman, I set out
on my first inquiry regarding Stanley Audley.</p>

<p>I took a taxi to the house in Half Moon Street in
which he had lived, and there saw Mr. Belton, the
proprietor.</p>

<p>He was a tall, bald-headed man in grey trousers
and morning coat and nothing could disguise the fact
that he was a retired butler. “Yes, sir,” he said in
reply to my inquiry, “Mr. Stanley Audley lived here
for nearly two years. But he went abroad a short
time ago, as I wired to you, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, the fact is, Mr. Belton, he’s disappeared,”
I said.</p>

<p>“Disappeared!” echoed the ex-butler.</p>

<p>“Yes, I wonder if I may glance at his rooms.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir. But they are let again. Colonel
Mayhew is out, so we can go up. Mr. Audley sent
all his things to store when he left, but I was away
at the time, so I don’t know where they went to.”
He took me to a well-furnished front sitting-room
on the first floor.</p>

<p>“Do you recollect that he had a lady visitor—a
tall, handsome, dark-eyed young lady, whose name
was Shaylor?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir. A young lady came once or twice
to tea, but I don’t know her name. And—well to
tell you the truth, sir, his movements were often
very curious.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>“How?” I asked, with sudden interest.</p>

<p>“Well, he would walk out without any luggage
sometimes, and then a week later I would hear from
him telling me to send on his letters to some Poste
Restante abroad. Once it was in Paris, another
time at Geneva and twice in Madrid. It always
struck me as very curious that he traveled without
any luggage—or if he had any, he never brought it
here.”</p>

<p>“Curious,” I said. “Then he was a bit of a
mystery?”</p>

<p>“He was, sir. That’s his photograph there, on
the mantleshelf,” and he pointed to a photograph in
a small oval ebony frame.</p>

<p>To my amazement it was the picture of a man I
had never seen in my life.</p>

<p>“But that round-faced man isn’t Stanley Audley!”
I exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, sir, but it is,” was the ex-butler’s
polite assertion. “He lived here nearly two years.”</p>

<p>“He is not the Stanley Audley for whom I am
searching, at any rate,” I said.</p>

<p>“Well, he is the only Mr. Audley that my wife
and I have had here.”</p>

<p>Suddenly I recollected that in my wallet I had a
snap-shot of Thelma on her skis which I had taken
up on the Allmendhubel. I drew it out and showed
it to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>“Ah! sir, that’s not the young lady who visited
Mr. Audley. That’s a young lady who came twice,
or perhaps three times to see Mr. Graydon.”</p>

<p>“What is Mr. Graydon like?” I asked eagerly.</p>

<p>In reply he gave me a very accurate description of
Thelma’s husband.</p>

<p>“Who, and what is Mr. Graydon?” I asked.
“Tell me, Mr. Belton, for much depends upon the
result of this inquiry.”</p>

<p>“He’s a young gentleman very well connected—nephew
of a certain earl, I believe. He had the
rooms above for about nine months, and was very
friendly with Mr. Audley.”</p>

<p>“And did he make mysterious journeys?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sometimes—but not very often.”</p>

<p>“Had he any profession?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“No. I understand that his father, who was a
landowner in Cheshire, left him with a very comfortable
income. My wife and I liked him, for he was a
quiet, rather studious young fellow, though often at
Mr. Audley’s invitation he went out of an evening
and did not return till the early hours. But now-a-days
with those dance clubs going, most young men
do that.”</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Belton, may I see Mr. Graydon’s
room?” I asked. In response, he took me up to the
next floor, where the sitting-room and bedroom were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
even cosier and better furnished than the rooms below.</p>

<p>“Mr. Graydon, when he left, laughingly said that
he might be married soon, but if he didn’t marry he’d
come back to us. He told my wife that he was going
on a yachting trip to Norway with some friends, and
afterwards he had to go to Montreal to visit some
relatives.”</p>

<p>“But the curious fact is that the man I knew as
Audley is none other than the man you know as
Graydon!” I said.</p>

<p>“That’s certainly very mysterious, sir. Mr. Graydon
must have assumed Mr. Audley’s name,” Belton
said.</p>

<p>“The whole affair is a complete mystery,” I remarked.
“I wish you’d tell me more that you know
concerning this Mr. Graydon. What was his
Christian name, by the way? And when did you
last see him?”</p>

<p>“Philip. He left us last September.”</p>

<p>“And the young lady who came to see him?”</p>

<p>“Oh! She was certainly a lady. Indeed, I rather
fancied that I had seen her several years ago, and
that with her mother she once came as guest of old
Lady Wentbrook, in whose service I was. But I
was not quite sure, and I could not, of course, inquire.
At any rate, she was a lady, of that there
could be no mistake.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>“And Mr. Graydon was a gentleman?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir. But I can’t vouch for Mr. Audley.
They were friends—and that’s all I know.”</p>

<p>“You had certain suspicions about Audley, and
were not sorry when he gave up his rooms?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, you’re quite right, I was.”</p>

<p>“And how about Graydon?”</p>

<p>“We were very sorry when he left, sir. My wife
liked him immensely. But she always said that he was
somehow under the influence of Mr. Audley.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever meet a Mr. Harold Ruthen?” I
asked.</p>

<p>And from my wallet I took another snap-shot
which showed him with a party of skaters on the
rink.</p>

<p>The ex-butler scrutinized it closely and replied:</p>

<p>“Yes. He’s been here. He was a friend of Mr.
Audley’s. But I don’t think that was his name. I
believe he was called Rutley, or some such name?”</p>

<p>“Did Mr. Graydon know him?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. Not to my knowledge. He came here
once and stayed with Mr. Audley while Mr. Graydon
was up in Scotland shooting. But we’ll go down
below and show the photograph to my wife. She
has a better memory than I have.”</p>

<p>So we went into the basement, where I had a long
conversation with Mrs. Belton, a typical retired
servant of the better class, shrewd and observant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>That conversation definitely established several
amazing facts which served to make the mystery of
Stanley Audley deeper and more sinister than ever.
It was clear—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<div class="hangingindent">
<p>(1) That Philip Graydon had, for some
reason we could not fathom, taken the
name of Stanley Audley, while Audley
had passed as Graydon.</p>

<p>(2) That the movements of the two men
were uncertain and mysterious.</p>

<p>(3) That Harold Ruthen, also known as
Rutley, was associated with both Stanley
Audley and the man Philip Graydon.</p>

<p>(4) That Thelma had married the man
who, passing as Philip Graydon, was
really Stanley Audley!</p>
</div></div>

<p>After that amazing revelation I passed along
Half Moon Street, in the winter darkness, to Piccadilly
in a state of utter bewilderment.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<small>THE HAM-BONE CLUB</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A few</span> days later a client of ours named Powell
for whom we were conducting a piece of rather intricate
business concerning a mortgage of some land
in Essex, invited me to join himself and his wife at
dinner at the Savoy.</p>

<p>Our table was in a corner near the orchestra and
the big restaurant was crowded. Sovrani, the famous
<i>maître d’hôtel</i> knew all three of us well and we
dined excellently under his tactful supervision.
After dinner Mrs. Powell, a pretty young woman,
exquisitely gowned, suggested a dance in the room
below. We went there and danced until about half-past
ten when Powell said:</p>

<p>“Let’s go to the Ham-bone.”</p>

<p>“The Ham-bone,” I echoed. “What on earth is
that?”</p>

<p>“Oh!” laughed Mrs. Powell, “it is one of London’s
merriest Bohemian dance clubs. The male
members are all artists, sculptors or literary men,
and the female members are all girls who earn their
own living—mannequins, secretaries, artists’ models
and girl journalists. It is screamingly amusing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
Quite Bohemian and yet high select, isn’t it, Harry?”</p>

<p>“I’ve never heard of it,” I said.</p>

<p>“Well, one gets a really splendid dinner there for
half-a-crown, though, of course, you get paper serviettes,
and for supper after the hours, you men can
have a kipper—a brand that is extra special—and a
drink with it,” she went on.</p>

<p>“Yes, Leila,” laughed her husband. “The place
is unique. Half the people in ‘smart’ society, men
as well as women, want to become members, but the
Committee, who are all well-known artists, don’t
want the man-about-town: they only want the real
hard-working Bohemians who go there at night for
relaxation. Burlac, the sculptor, put me up.”</p>

<p>The novelty of the idea attracted me, so we went
in a taxicab to an uninviting looking mews off Great
Windmill Street, behind the Café Monico in Piccadilly
Circus. Walking up it, we passed through a
narrow swing-door, over which hung a dim feeble
light and a big ham-bone!</p>

<p>Up a precipitous flight of narrow stone steps we
went until we reached a little door where a stout ex-sergeant
of police smiled recognition upon my host,
placed a book before him to sign and relieved us of
our coats.</p>

<p>In a room above a piano was being played by someone
who was evidently an artist and dancing was in
progress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>The place might have been a cabaret in the
<i>Montmartre</i> in Paris. I thought I knew London’s
night clubs fairly well—the Embassy, Ciro’s, the
Grafton, the Mayfair, the Royalty, the Twenty,
Murray’s, Tate’s, the Trippers, the Dainty, and
others—but when I entered the big whitewashed
dancing room I found myself looking on a scene that
was a complete novelty to me.</p>

<p>The room was long and narrow. The walls were
painted in stripes representing oaken beams and set
around them were many small tables. The floor was
filled with merry dancers, among whom I recognized
many people well-known in artistic and social circles.
Some of the men wore dinner jackets and many of
the women were in beautiful evening dress, but smart
clothes evidently were regarded as a non-essential,
for a large proportion of the men wore ordinary
lounge suits.</p>

<p>As we stood watching the scene a tall, elderly man
rose from a table and cried:</p>

<p>“Hulloa! Leila! What a stranger you are!”</p>

<p>My hostess smiled and waved recognition, whereupon
her friend—a portrait painter whose reputation
was world-wide, bowed over her hand and said:</p>

<p>“Well, only fancy! It is really delightful that you
should return to us! We thought we’d lost you
after you married!”</p>

<p>“My dear Charlie,” she laughed—for it was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
rule in the Ham-bone that every member addressed
every one else by his or her Christian name, and
“Charlie” was a Royal Academician—“I am an old
Hamyardian: I was one of the first lady members.”</p>

<p>“Of course. You’ll find Marigold here. I’ve just
been chatting with her. She’s round the corner, over
yonder. But she’s funny. What’s the matter with
her? Do you know?” he added in a low, serious
voice.</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t know there was anything wrong,”
replied my hostess.</p>

<p>It was easy to realize that here in this stable converted
into a club was an atmosphere and an environment
without its like in London or elsewhere.
The denizens of that little circle of Bohemia cared
for absolutely nothing and nobody outside its own
careless world whose boundaries were Chelsea and
the Savoy Club.</p>

<p>Ordinary social distinctions were utterly and completely
ignored. Gayety was supreme and in the
merry throng I caught sight within a few minutes of
a well-known London magistrate before whom I had
often pleaded as a Solicitor, a famous scientist, the
millionaire owner of a great daily paper. Several
leading members of the Chancery Bar, an under-secretary
of State and quite a sprinkling of young
scions of patrician families.</p>

<p>They were men and women of the intellectual type<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
who cared nothing for the vicious joys of the ordinary
night club. They came in frank enjoyment of
dancing and music and the fried kippers, as custom
decreed, in order to comply with the kill-joy law that
ordained that they must eat if they wanted a drink!
Everything, apparently, was free and easy gaiety.
Yet it was at least as difficult to become a member
of the Ham-bone as to gain admission to any of the
most exclusive clubs along Pall Mall. Money was
no sort of passport: only personality, ability or the
true inborn spirit of Bohemianism could open the
portals of the Ham-bone.</p>

<p>The “master of ceremonies” was a well-known
landscape painter, whom every one addressed as
“George,” a smart figure in the brown velvet jacket
of his profession. He chaffed and joked with every
one in French, revealing a side of his nature certainly
unsuspected by the general public to whom he usually
presented a grave and austere front. But this was
the key-note of the Ham-bone: every one seemed to
“let himself go” and the stilted social etiquette of
our ordinary world seemed as far off as if we had
been in Limehouse or Poplar.</p>

<p>I was dancing with Mrs. Powell, when, suddenly,
she halted before a small table in a corner where
there sat alone a beautiful dark-haired girl in a
smartly cut dance-frock of black charmeuse.</p>

<p>“Mr. Yelverton,” she said, “will you let me introduce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
you to my dearest friend, Marigold Day?”
And to the girl she said, “Marigold, this is Mr. Rex
Yelverton, the gentleman of whom I recently spoke
to you.”</p>

<p>Somberly dressed, her white neck and bare arms
in vivid contrast with her dead-black frock, she
was almost wickedly beautiful. Her well-dressed
hair, across which she wore a bandeau of golden
leaves, was dark; her scarlet mouth was like the
curling underleaves of a rose, her lips with the true
<i>arc-de-cupidon</i> so seldom seen, were slightly apart,
and between them showed strong white teeth. Her
eyes were large and deeply violet and they held a
fascination such as I had seldom before seen.</p>

<p>“We’ll be back presently,” said Mrs. Powell, as
we slipped again into the dance. “I want to have a
chat with you.”</p>

<p>“Who’s that?” I asked, as soon as we were a few
feet away.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s Marigold. We are fellow-members
here. She was in business with me before I married.
Isn’t she very good-looking, don’t you think?”</p>

<p>“Beautiful,” I declared.</p>

<p>“Ah, I see,” laughed my partner. “You are like
all the other men. They all admire her, and want
to dance with her. But Marigold is a queer girl: I
can never make her out in these days. Once she was
very bright and merry, and always gadding about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
somewhere with a man named Audley. Now there’s
a kink somewhere. She accepts no invitations, keeps
herself to herself, and only on rare occasions comes
here just to look on. A great change has come over
her. Why, I can’t make out. We were the closest
of friends before I married, so I’ve asked her the
reason of it all, but she will tell me absolutely
nothing.”</p>

<p>“Audley,” I gasped. “Where is she at business?”</p>

<p>“At Carille’s, the dressmakers in Dover Street.
She’s a mannequin, and I was a typist there,” she
replied. “And now Mr. Yelverton, you know what
was my business before I married,” she added, with
a laugh.</p>

<p>“Pretty boring, I should say, showing off dresses
to a pack of unappreciative old cats,” was my
remark.</p>

<p>“Boring isn’t the word for it,” Mrs. Powell declared,
“I couldn’t have stood her work. You
should see our clients—uneducated, fat, coarse, war-rich
old hags who look Marigold up and down, and
fancy they will appear as smart as she does in one
of Monsieur Carille’s latest creations. How Marigold
sticks at it so long I can’t make out. She ought
to be awarded the prize medal for patience. I could
never amble about over that horrid grey carpet and
place my neck, my elbows and hands at absurd angles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
for the benefit of those ugly old tabbies—no matter
what salary I was paid!”</p>

<p>At that moment we found ourselves before the
table where her husband was seated, smoking and
drinking coffee with Sava, the young Serbian who
was perhaps the greatest modern caricaturist.</p>

<p>Belgravia is good; Bohemia is better; the combination
of both is surely Paradise! Sava’s conversation
was as perfect as his caricatures: he had
seen life in every capital in Europe and was a born
raconteur. For a time he held us engrossed with
his witty comments on the men and matters of half-a-dozen
countries, all of which he knew to perfection.</p>

<p>Never have I seen so truly fraternal a circle as
that little backwater of Bohemianism. Every one
was at his ease: there was no such a thing as being a
stranger there. The fact that you <i>were</i> there—that
some member had introduced you and vouched for
you—broke down all barriers and men who had
never before met and might never meet again met
and chatted as freely as if they were old friends and
with an utter disregard of all the vexing problems of
wealth, rank, profession and precedence.</p>

<p>Presently my hostess took me back to the mannequin
in black whom I new realized must be wearing
a copy of one of the famous man-dressmaker’s latest
creations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>“Mr. Yelverton wants a partner, Marigold,” my
companion exclaimed gayly, whereupon her friend
smiled and rising at once, joined me in a fox-trot
with an expression of pleasure upon her face. She
was a splendid dancer.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Powell has told me of your acquaintance
with Mr. Audley,” I said, after a few minutes of
the usual ball-room chat. “I wonder if it is the same
man I know. He used to live in Half Moon Street.”</p>

<p>She clearly resented the question. “Why do you
ask?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“Because I’ve lost sight of my friend of late,” I
replied.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Audley did live in Half Moon Street,
but he has gone away,” she replied. And I thought I
detected a hint of tragedy upon her face.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<small>IN THE WEB</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As we</span> danced Marigold told me something more
about herself. She lived, I found, with three other
business girls at a boarding house in Bayswater, going
by tube to Dover Street each day. She had met
Audley and for a time they had been rather friendly,
seeing a good deal of each other. I guessed, though
of course she did not tell me, that the friendship
bade fair to ripen into something deeper. Then Audley
had suddenly disappeared.</p>

<p>As our dance ended Mrs. Powell came up and we
all went up the narrow wooden staircase to the balcony
where, as we enjoyed our Bohemian supper, we
could watch the dancing below.</p>

<p>It was just before midnight, when the fun was
fast and furious and the “Hamyardians,” as the
merry circle call themselves, were enjoying themselves
in the wildest and most nonsensical fashion,
that Marigold Day, glancing at her wrist watch, declared
that she must go. I went down with her to
the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>“Can’t you tell me some more about Audley?” I
asked just before she entered her taxi.</p>

<p>She shook her head. “Don’t ask me, please,” she
said and she entered the taxi and was driven away
towards Bayswater.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think of Marigold?” asked
Mrs. Powell, as I resumed my seat at the supper
table.</p>

<p>“She’s altogether charming, of course,” I replied,
“but rather—well, I don’t quite know the word. I
should almost say mysterious: at any rate she seems
to be troubled about something and trying to hide
it.”</p>

<p>“That’s it, exactly,” declared my hostess. “During
the past few months she seems to have become an
entirely different girl. As you know, we were the
closest of friends. She seems to live in constant
dread of something, but she absolutely refuses to
tell me what it is. Indeed, she declares there is
nothing wrong, but that is nonsense. No one who
knew her six months ago could fail to realize that
something is very wrong indeed.”</p>

<p>“Do you know anything about her friend, Mr.
Audley,” I ventured to ask.</p>

<p>“Not very much,” said Mrs. Powell. “Of course,
I have met him. Marigold was getting very fond of
him, I believe, but she will not talk about him.”</p>

<p>Powell came up and declared it was time to go and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
I had no opportunity of questioning Mrs. Powell any
further, much as I wished to do so. However, I determined
to see her again and also to meet Marigold
Day and see whether either of them could give
me further details about Audley. Was he the real
Audley? I wondered, or the man who had taken his
name.</p>

<p>A few days later I received a letter from Mrs.
Shaylor inviting me to go to Bexhill.</p>

<p>I was in two minds about accepting. I wanted to
see Thelma—wanted to help her and certainly did
not want to lose touch with her as I might if I refused
to go. But was it wise?</p>

<p>Of course, inclination conquered prudence and I
went. I found that she and her mother lived in a
pretty red-roofed, red-brick detached house, with
high gables, and a small garden in front. It stood
in Bedford Avenue, close to the Sackville Hotel and
facing the sea.</p>

<p>Mrs. Shaylor, a pleasant, grey-haired woman of a
very refined type, greeted me warmly and thanked
me cordially for what I had done for her daughter
in Mürren, while Thelma expressed her delight at
seeing me again.</p>

<p>I got a chance during the morning of speaking to
Mrs. Shaylor alone and asked her if Thelma had
heard anything more of her husband.</p>

<p>“Not a word,” was Mrs. Shaylor’s reply. “It is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
most disastrous affair for her, poor girl. The suspense
and anxiety are killing her.”</p>

<p>“She does not look so well,” I replied. I had, in
fact, been struck by the change in the girl. She was
paler and thinner and it was evident the strain was
telling on her rather heavily.</p>

<p>“I understand you did not know very much of
Mr. Audley,” I said.</p>

<p>“Very little indeed, unfortunately,” was Mrs.
Shaylor’s reply. “Thelma met him when she was
staying with her aunt at the Majestic at Harrogate,
and they became friendly. He appeared to have
considerable means for he gave Thelma some very
beautiful jewelry. He came down here once, saw
me, and asked if he might marry her. He told me
certain things about his relations in India, and she
seemed so entirely devoted to him that I gave my
consent to their marriage in three months. But,
judge my surprise when a fortnight later they were
married secretly and left next day for Switzerland
for their honeymoon.”</p>

<p>“Then you really know very little of him, Mrs.
Shaylor?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Very little indeed. It was a most foolish and
ill-advised marriage. He seems to have lied to her
here and then deserted her.”</p>

<p>“I must say I liked what I saw of him,” I said,
“and I wonder whether we are right in thinking that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
he really deserted her in the ordinary meaning of
the word. It looks like it, of course, but it has occurred
to me, though I have only very slight grounds
to go on, that he is being kept away from her by
some influence at which we cannot guess. He really
seemed devoted to her and genuinely sorry to have
to leave her.”</p>

<p>“Well, she certainly seems devoted to him and
will not hear a word against him. But what can one
think under the circumstances?”</p>

<p>The drawing-room opened on to a wide verandah
and across the promenade we could see the rolling
Channel surf beating upon the beach. The winter’s
day was dull and boisterous and now and again
sheets of flying spray swept across the promenade.</p>

<p>“He pretended to me that he was an electrical
engineer,” I remarked, “but I have found out that
the firm for whom he said he worked knows nothing
of him.”</p>

<p>“That is what he also told me. But I have reason
to believe that he is in fact a young man of considerable
fortune. Yet, if so, why has he deserted poor
Thelma?”</p>

<p>“I am doing my level best to find him, Mrs. Shaylor,”
I said. “Some very great mystery enshrouds
this affair, and I have, in your daughter’s interest,
set myself to solve it.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure all this is extremely good of you,” she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
said, gratefully. “We are only women, and both of
us powerless.”</p>

<p>I paused for a moment. Then I said:</p>

<p>“I really came down here, Mrs. Shaylor, to put
several direct questions to you. I wonder if you will
answer them and thus lighten my task. I am a solicitor,
as perhaps you already know.”</p>

<p>“Certainly. What are they?”</p>

<p>“Has your daughter ever known a man named
Harold Ruthen?”</p>

<p>The lady’s face changed, and her brows contracted
slightly. “Why do you ask that?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“Because it has a direct bearing upon the present
situation.”</p>

<p>“Well—yes. I believe she has, or had, a friend
of that name. A man who lives in Paris.”</p>

<p>“Was he a friend of Audley’s?”</p>

<p>“Not to my knowledge.”</p>

<p>“Have you ever heard of a girl named Marigold
Day—a mannequin at Carille’s?”</p>

<p>“Never.”</p>

<p>I paused. Then I bent towards her and said,
very earnestly, “Has it ever struck you, Mrs. Shaylor,
that your daughter knows just a little more concerning
Stanley Audley than she has yet told us?”</p>

<p>“Why do you ask that question?” she inquired.</p>

<p>“Well—because somehow it has struck me so,” I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
said. “And I will go a little further. I believe she
knows where her husband is, but—for some reason
or other—fears to betray him!”</p>

<p>“Is that your suspicion?” she asked, in a low
strained voice.</p>

<p>“Yes,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Mr. Yelverton,” she said very slowly. “I admit
that it is mine also! I’ve questioned Thelma time
after time, but she will tell me nothing—absolutely
nothing!”</p>

<p>“Are there any more facts you can tell me—anything
to throw further light upon these strange circumstances?”
I asked her.</p>

<p>“No,” was her reply. “I’m afraid I know nothing
else. Thelma is worried. I feel terrified lest
the real truth—whatever it may be—concerning her
husband, be disclosed.”</p>

<p>Thelma came in and we talked of other matters.
She made great fun of my position as her “temporary
husband” at Mürren and seemed in better spirits
than when I came down.</p>

<p>After luncheon we went for a stroll together
through the driving health-giving breeze to Cooden
Beach, and then back for tea. Thelma wore a
serviceable golf suit, thick brogues and carried a
stick, while her Airedale “Jock” ran at our side.</p>

<p>On the way I told her of my adventure at the
Ham-bone Club. She was much interested in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
queer pranks of the Hamyardians and to find out
how much she knew, I told her about Marigold Day:
in fact I deliberately “enthused” about her. I
watched her closely, but it was evident Marigold’s
name meant nothing to her. Then I went on the
more open tack and tried to get some further facts
from her. It was in vain: she seemed as determined
to keep her knowledge to herself as I was to get at
the truth.</p>

<p>At last, as we neared the house, I made a direct
attack.</p>

<p>“Now look here, Thelma,” I said, “do be frank.
You know where Stanley is, don’t you?”</p>

<p>She went pale: it was evident that it had never
struck her that I might guess at the truth.</p>

<p>“Why do you say that?” she asked sharply.</p>

<p>“Because I am certain Stanley has enemies and
wants help.”</p>

<p>“Enemies!” she said, with an attempt to laugh
“why should he have enemies? What do you
mean?”</p>

<p>“All that I have said. Cannot you trust me? If
your husband is in hiding for some unknown reason
I should not betray him.”</p>

<p>“I have promised to say nothing,” she said
blankly. “I cannot break my promise.”</p>

<p>“Why does he not return to you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>“There is a reason—he never can. We must live
apart in future.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders, and after a few moments
of hesitation replied—</p>

<p>“There are certain facts, Mr. Yelverton, that I
am forbidden by Stanley to disclose. I have told you
that we cannot be united again. That is all. Please
make no further inquiries.”</p>

<p>“But I will. You have been left in my care,” I
asserted.</p>

<p>“If you do!—if you do it—it may be at your
peril,” she declared, in a hard unnatural voice, looking
curiously at me as she opened the gate. “Recollect,
Mr. Yelverton, that my words are a warning.”</p>

<p>“But why?” I cried.</p>

<p>“I—I unfortunately cannot tell you,” was her
reply, and we re-entered her charming home together.</p>

<p>I returned to London more mystified than ever.
The dual personality of Stanley Audley, combined
with the fact that his wife undoubtedly knew of his
whereabouts; her steadfast determination not to
disclose one single fact, and the strange threats I
had heard Ruthen utter, all combined to puzzle me
beyond measure.</p>

<p>For a couple of days I did my best to attend to
business, but constantly I found my mind dwelling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
on the mystery of Stanley Audley. I could not concentrate
on legal problems and most of my work
fell on Hensman’s shoulders.</p>

<p>On the third night, after my visit to Bexhill, when
I returned to my rooms from the office, I found,
lying upon my table, a typewritten note which had
been delivered that afternoon. It bore the Hammersmith
postmark.</p>

<p>Tearing it open I read some lines of rather indifferent
typing, as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You have formed a friendship with Mrs. Thelma
Audley. I warn you that such friendship, if continued, will
be at the cost of your own life. Divert your love-making
into another direction. I have no personal animosity against
you but you are placing yourself in the way of powerful
interests, and you will be removed if necessary.”</p>
</div>

<p>I read and re-read this strange message. Thelma’s
warning leaped to my mind. Was there, then,
a real risk to myself in the strange coil?</p>

<p>Then something—sheer obstinacy I suppose—came
to my help and I declared to myself that I
would go ahead with my self-imposed task; that
nothing—least of all mere cowardice—should induce
me to give it up.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<small>DOCTOR FENG’S VIEW</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I am</span> not going to deny that at first that strange
warning perturbed me a good deal. After all, I
make no claim to be a hero and not even a hero
likes threats of death, even though they be anonymous.
At the same time, I never proposed, even
in thought, to give up my quest. For, whether I
wished it or not, I could not shake myself free of
Thelma’s influence: my day-dreams were themselves
on the fancy that some day, in some way, she would
be free. More and more I began to think that
she had married Audley so suddenly under an overwhelming
girlish impulse; perhaps her mind had
been made up by some story he had told her to
justify haste and secrecy. If this were really so,
would her love survive desertion and a separation
which she herself apparently regarded as permanent?
It would be strange, indeed, if it did.</p>

<p>So, through the dark March days that followed,
I worked at the office half the day, while the remainder
I devoted to seeking traces of the mysterious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
young man who had lived in Half Moon Street
under the name of Graydon.</p>

<p>Mrs. Powell and her husband had been suddenly
called abroad. But Marigold Day was an obvious
source of possible information and to make further
inquiry of her I wrote asking her to dine with
me one evening at the Cecil.</p>

<p>She accepted, and we ate our dinner at one of
the tables set in the window of the big grill-room
overlooking the Embankment. She again wore her
plain black dress which enhanced the whiteness of
her arms and shoulders and laughed merrily at
me across the table as we chatted over dinner.</p>

<p>I hesitated to refer to Audley directly after the
conversation of our previous meeting, but I asked
her suddenly whether she happened to know a man
named Harold Ruthen.</p>

<p>“Harold Ruthen?” she echoed, “Yes, but why
do you ask?”</p>

<p>“Because he was a friend of Audley’s,” was my
reply. “Do you happen to know him?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. I saw him only a few days ago.
He’s looking for Audley—he believes he is in
Paris.”</p>

<p>“Now, I wonder if the Mr. Audley you know
is the same man as my friend. Will you describe
him?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>She did so, and the description made it clear that
he was indeed Thelma’s husband.</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said. “He is no doubt the same.”</p>

<p>“He was well-known at the Ham-bone, where
every one called him Stanley,” she said. “But I
can’t think why he disappeared and has never written
to me. A girl told me that he’d married. But
I don’t believe it.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“For the simple reason that he had asked me
to marry him,” was the startling reply.</p>

<p>“Was Ruthen on very friendly terms with him?”</p>

<p>“Yes. But Stanley did not like him. He used
to tell me that Ruthen was not straight, and I
know he avoided him whenever he could. I suppose
we all hate most those we fear most.”</p>

<p>“Why do you say that?” I asked in some surprise
at her philosophy.</p>

<p>“Well,” she said, “I always had a suspicion that
Stanley went in fear of Ruthen. Why, I don’t
know.”</p>

<p>“That’s curious. What made you think so?”</p>

<p>“From certain remarks he once let drop.”</p>

<p>“Then Audley may be hiding purposely from
that fellow?” I exclaimed, as I recollected that queer
conversation between Ruthen and Thelma.</p>

<p>“I have thought that possible, but even then, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
could easily write to me in confidence, and tell me
where he is,” said the girl.</p>

<p>“Where does Ruthen live?” I enquired.</p>

<p>“In Whitehall Court,” and she gave me the
number.</p>

<p>“You have no idea what his profession may be?”</p>

<p>“Like Stanley—he is independent.”</p>

<p>“Audley is a rich man, isn’t he?” I asked.</p>

<p>“No doubt. When we first met he gave me some
very expensive presents merely because I happened
to look after a girl he knew who was suffering from
pneumonia. He’s an awfully generous boy, you
know.”</p>

<p>“The fact is, Miss Day, I am doing all I can
to discover Stanley Audley. Can you tell me any
other facts—anything concerning his other friends?”</p>

<p>“He had another friend named Graydon, living
at the same chambers in Half Moon Street, a rather
stout, round-faced man. But he has also left London,
I understand.”</p>

<p>“Graydon!” I ejaculated. So it seemed that the
pair exchanged names when occasion required. At
Half Moon Street Audley was Graydon, but outside,
he took the name of the man who lived on the
floor below!</p>

<p>What could have been the motive?</p>

<p>I afterwards took my pretty companion to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
theatre, and, later, she took me to Ham-Bone Club,
where we danced till nearly two.</p>

<p>From members there, I gleaned several facts concerning
Stanley Audley. He was apparently a rich
young “man-about-town,” but surrounded, as all
wealthy young men are, by parasites who sponged
upon his generosity. Of these Harold Ruthen was
undoubtedly one.</p>

<p>Days passed, and although I went hither and
thither, making inquiries in all likely quarters, I
could obtain no further knowledge. Stanley Audley
had disappeared. I felt more convinced than ever
that Thelma possessed knowledge she feared to
disclose.</p>

<p>In my perplexity, I thought, at last, of old Dr.
Feng. Perhaps he would be able to help me. I
wrote to him in care of his solicitor and received
a prompt reply asking me to go and see him at an
address in Castlenau, Barnes.</p>

<p>The house was just across Hammersmith Bridge.
The anonymous letter I had received had been
posted, I remembered, at Hammersmith. It was
a queer coincidence.</p>

<p>Doctor Feng’s house, I found, was of a large,
old-fashioned detached residence which, a century
ago, had probably been the dwelling-place of some
rich City Merchant who drove each morning into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
London in his high dog-cart, his “tiger” with folded
arms seated behind him.</p>

<p>A maid conducted me to the front sitting-room,
a large, well-furnished apartment, where a big fire
blazed.</p>

<p>“Well, Yelverton!” exclaimed the old doctor,
rising, and putting out his hand. “And how are
you? I went to see my sister down at Mentone,
but the weather on the Riviera was simply abominable—a
mistral all the time. So I came back and
took up my quarters here. Comfortable—aren’t
they? Sit down. It’s real good to see you again!”</p>

<p>I stretched myself in a deep comfortable chair
beside the fire, and we chatted for a time about
Mürren.</p>

<p>“I wonder where Humphreys is?” he remarked.
“He wasn’t a bad sort, was he? And how about
your temporary bride—the ‘Little Lady,’ as you
called her!”</p>

<p>“Well, doctor,” I said, “that is really what I
came to see you about. The whole affair is a tangle
and I wondered if you could help me. I have found
out a lot of things about Stanley Audley that are
certainly most disconcerting and mysterious.”</p>

<p>He passed a box of cigars. “Have a smoke over
it,” he said, “if I can help you I will. But first tell
me what happened after I left Mürren.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>“A lot,” I replied. “You know Thelma’s husband
left for London. Well, he never came back.”</p>

<p>“The young cad,” said the doctor. “But, after
all, I more than half expected it.”</p>

<p>“Why?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, hesitatingly, “shall we say his
sudden departure was rather suspicious? To put
it plainly the excuse was a bit thin. Would any
firm let an employee start on a honeymoon and
three days later find he was the man for an important
appointment such as Audley spoke of? Of
course, such a thing <i>might</i> happen, but a more probable
excuse would have carried more conviction. To
me it suggested a story made up suddenly, in default
if anything better, to explain a departure
forced upon him by some much less welcome reason.
However, I had no reason for saying this at the
time and, after all, I might have been wrong. But
as things have turned out it seems I was right and
I am very sorry for his wife. After all, whatever
her husband may be, she is a charming girl—much
too good for him, anyhow. But go on, tell me
what you have found out.”</p>

<p>I frankly told him, and as he smoked he sat back
listening thoughtfully without a word of comment.</p>

<p>At last, when I had concluded, he asked—</p>

<p>“Have you seen Harold Ruthen?”</p>

<p>“Not yet. He is an enemy of Thelma’s.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>“What makes you think that?” he asked, whereupon
I told him of the curious conversation I had
overheard.</p>

<p>He bit his lip and smiled mysteriously, but said
nothing. It was, however, plain that what I had
described greatly interested him.</p>

<p>“And little Mrs. Audley will tell you nothing—eh?
She refuses. She is evidently hiding some
secret of her husband’s. Don’t you think so?”</p>

<p>“To me, she seems in deadly fear lest I should
discover her husband.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I quite agree, Yelverton,” the old man
said. “There’s more behind this curious affair than
we’ve hitherto suspected. A man doesn’t leave his
young wife in the hands of a stranger without some
strong and very doubtful motive. Depend upon it
that you were marked down as the victim.”</p>

<p>“Not by Thelma!” I protested.</p>

<p>“No, she has been your fellow victim.”</p>

<p>“But the motive of it all?” I asked in dismay.
“What is your opinion, doctor?”</p>

<p>“The same that I formed when you first told me
of your offer of help—that you’ve been a silly idiot,
Yelverton. Didn’t I point out at the time the risks
you were running?”</p>

<p>“Yes, you did,” I replied, “but I still intend—at
all hazards—to get to the bottom of the affair.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>Feng hesitated, and then, looking me straight
in the face, said very seriously—</p>

<p>“If you take my advice you will drop the whole
affair.”</p>

<p>“Why?” I asked, in surprise.</p>

<p>“Because those men who lived at Half Moon
Street and their friends are evidently a very queer
lot. In any case you ought to cease visiting Mrs.
Audley.”</p>

<p>I paused, recollecting that strange warning I had
received, of which I had not told him.</p>

<p>“But, after all,” I protested, “we are very good
friends. Surely I ought to help her by finding her
husband?”</p>

<p>“When she probably knows where he is all the
time!” scoffed Feng. “I don’t see what good you
will do that way.”</p>

<p>“Anyhow,” I said shortly, “I’m not going to see
her left in the lurch like this if I can help it.”</p>

<p>“Really, Yelverton, I don’t see what good you
think you can do. We both believe she knows
where he is. If that is so why should you interfere?
Of course, what you tell me about the girl Day is
very interesting and may throw a good deal of light
on Stanley Audley’s character. But, after all, men
change their minds and if Audley preferred Thelma
to Marigold, there was no reason why he should
not have asked her to marry him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>“None the less, take my advice, drop the whole
thing. You haven’t the shadow of a legal right to
interfere. The men who lived in Half Moon Street,
quite obviously a shady lot, have fled, evidently
frightened of something and apparently your temporary
bride is as frightened as they are. I don’t
see why you should run any risk in the matter.”</p>

<p>“But what earthly risk do I run?” I asked.
“Surely I am capable of looking after myself.”</p>

<p>“Considerably more risk than you imagine, unless
I am very much mistaken,” he replied gravely.</p>

<p>I wondered for a moment whether my mysterious
warning had come from the doctor himself. But
what could he know about the affair? I could not
read anything in his inscrutable face, but his manner
certainly suggested that he was in deadly earnest,
and, to my intense surprise, he suddenly let
fall a remark, quite unintentionally, I believed, that,
I realized with a curious suspicion, showed that he
knew Thelma and her mother were living at Bexhill.
Here was indeed a new complication. I made
no sign that I had noticed his slip, but sat as if
thinking deeply, as indeed I was.</p>

<p>How, and for what purpose, had he obtained that
information. He had professed not to know what
had happened after he had left Mürren.</p>

<p>The idea flashed through my mind that he and
Thelma were acting in collusion to “call me off,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
but this seemed so absurd that I dismissed it at once.</p>

<p>“Now, look here, Yelverton,” he said presently.
“You’ve not told me everything.”</p>

<p>“Yes I have,” I protested.</p>

<p>“You haven’t told me that you’ve fallen deeply
in love with little Mrs. Audley. That is why I
warned you—and still warn you—of rocks ahead.”</p>

<p>“I did not think that necessary,” I said with some
heat. “That is surely my own affair!”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” he said, dryly, in the paternal tone
he sometimes assumed. “But remember my first
view of the situation was the correct one. I thought
you extremely indiscreet to accept the trust you did.
It was a highly dangerous one—for you.”</p>

<p>“But you agreed afterwards that I did the right
thing,” I argued.</p>

<p>“You acted generously in the Little Lady’s interests,
but you have certainly fallen into some extraordinary
trap. That’s my point of view,” he answered.
“In any case, you are in love with a wife
whose husband is absent. That is quite enough to
constitute a very grave danger to both of you.
So, if I were you I’d keep away from her. Take
my advice as an old man.”</p>

<p>His repeated warning angered me, and I fear
that I did not attempt to conceal my impatience.
At any rate I took my leave rather abruptly, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
as I walked in the direction of Hammersmith Bridge
I felt more than ever puzzled at his attitude, and
more than ever determined not to deviate from
the course upon which I had embarked.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>CROOKED PATHS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> cold evening I returned from the office after
a heavy day which had been devoted to the successful
settlement of a very complicated and serious
action for libel against a provincial newspaper which
we represented.</p>

<p>As I entered my room, Mrs. Chapman, in her
spotless black dress—just as she always wore when
my father was alive—followed me in, saying—</p>

<p>“Oh! Mr. Rex. A gentleman called about three
o’clock. He wouldn’t leave a card. He gave his
name as Audley—Mr. Stanley Audley. He repeated
it three times, and told me to be sure to recollect
the name. He said he was extremely sorry
you were not at home, but you were not to worry
about him in the least.”</p>

<p>I started, staring blankly at her.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t leave a card? Wouldn’t he call
again?”</p>

<p>“He seemed to be in a very great hurry, sir. He
said he had come from abroad to see you, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
couldn’t wait and said he was very sorry. Only I
was to give you his urgent message.”</p>

<p>“What was he like?”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, he was a round, rather red-faced gentleman.
He was evidently greatly disappointed at
not meeting you, but he impressed upon me the
message that he was all right, and that you were
not to worry about him.”</p>

<p>This was indeed a surprise.</p>

<p>It was evident that my caller was the man who
had lived on the first floor in Half Moon Street,
and was the friend of the Stanley Audley who had
married Thelma!</p>

<p>What did that amazing visit portend? It worried
me. Why should a reassuring message be
given to me by a man who was not the person in
whom I was interested, and whom I had never met?
The whole affair was becoming more and more
obscure and mysterious. As a solicitor I had been
brought into contact with more than one queer affair,
but the Audley mystery was beyond anything in my
experience.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t he call again, Mrs. Chapman?” I
asked.</p>

<p>“No, sir. He said he had come to see you just
for a moment, and that he was sorry that he couldn’t
wait. He had a taxi outside.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, Mrs. Chapman. I’m sorry I was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
at home to see him. Did you give him my office
address?”</p>

<p>“I did, sir. But he said he had no time to go
round to Bedford Row, and that you would no
doubt understand.”</p>

<p>Understand! What could I understand? I was
more bewildered than ever.</p>

<p>Next day I called again upon Belton, in Half
Moon Street, and questioned him more closely about
his recent “Box and Cox” tenants. But he could
tell me nothing more than he had already. Mr.
Graydon and Mr. Audley were close friends. That
was all.</p>

<p>“Tell me something about their visitors,” I asked.
“Did Mr. Graydon, the gentleman who lived above,
have many?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. Very few. Several of them I knew
quite well when I was in service—gentlemen from
the clubs. One a Canadian millionaire, came often,
but Mr. Graydon never had any lady visitors except
that young lady we spoke about a short time
ago—the lady whose photograph you showed me,
Miss Shaylor.”</p>

<p>“And Mr. Audley, who lived below?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he had quite a lot of callers—both ladies
and gentlemen. He was older than Mr. Graydon,
and seemed to have quite a big circle of acquaintances.
They used to play bridge a lot.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>“Now, tell me, Mr. Belton. What is your private
opinion about your tenants?”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, as you are a solicitor”—he had gained
that knowledge from my card,—“I can speak quite
frankly. Now that they are gone I don’t mind
saying I held them both in suspicion. They had
plenty of money and paid well, but I don’t think they
were on the straight. That’s my firm opinion and
my wife thinks the same.”</p>

<p>“What first aroused your suspicion?”</p>

<p>“Their card parties. They weren’t always square.
I’m sure of it. Mr. Audley had an invalid friend,
an old man named Davies, who came about three
times, and when he came woe betide those who
played. I kept my eyes and ears open when I
served their drinks, and I’m sure I am not mistaken.”</p>

<p>“An invalid!” I exclaimed. “What kind of man
was he?”</p>

<p>“Oh! he was very lame, was Mr. Davies, sir. An
old man, but as keen as mustard on poker.”</p>

<p>“Did Mr. Graydon play?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Very little, sir.”</p>

<p>“Did he ever meet this Mr. Davies?”</p>

<p>“I think not, sir. Because on the first occasion
Mr. Davies came I recollect that Mr. Graydon was
away in Norway. The next time he came, Mr.
Graydon was away in Paris. No,” he went on, “as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
far as I can recollect Mr. Graydon never met Mr.
Davies.”</p>

<p>“Then this Mr. Davies was a person to be
avoided?” I suggested.</p>

<p>“Distinctly so, sir. He was a shrewd and clever
gambler, and I feel certain that he was in league
with Mr. Audley. Indeed, I know that on the morning
after one of their sittings they divided up a
thousand pounds between them. It had been won
from a man named Raikes, a manufacturer from
Sheffield.”</p>

<p>“So they shared the spoils?” I said. “But tell me
more about this interesting invalid.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir. He was a grey-bearded man of about
sixty I should think, and he walked with difficulty
with two sticks. He seemed to lisp when he spoke.”</p>

<p>It struck me at once that the ex-butler’s description
would have fitted old Mr. Humphreys very
closely, except that Humphreys did not lisp. I had
no reason for thinking that Humphreys could have
known Graydon, but he might have done so and
he certainly was a very keen poker player.</p>

<p>“Had he a rather scraggy, pointed beard and
did he wear in his tie a blue scarab pin?” I asked.</p>

<p>“No,” was Belton’s prompt reply, “he had a
round beard and I never saw him wearing a scarab
pin.”</p>

<p>Now old Mr. Humphreys always wore an antique<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
pin of that description; I never saw him without
it. He was immensely proud of it and used to
declare it was a mascot that brought him good
luck. He had a wonderful story of how he obtained
it from some old Egyptian tomb. So the chance
of Mr. Davies and old Humphreys being identical
seemed a coincidence almost too peculiar to be true.
Yet I could not get rid of a suspicion that they were
one and the same person.</p>

<p>“You are quite certain that he never met the
young gentleman you knew as Mr. Graydon?” I
asked Belton.</p>

<p>“I’m quite certain of that, sir. One day Mr.
Audley asked me not to say that Mr. Davies had
been there, and asked that I would keep his visits
a secret from young Graydon as he did not wish
them to meet. There was, I remember, a lady
named Temperley, who sometimes came with Mr.
Davies. She was a stout, dark-eyed, over-dressed
woman whom I put down as a retired actress. She
had a young, thin rather ugly daughter, a girl with
a long face, and protruding teeth. Both mother
and daughter seemed to be on terms of close friendship
with Mr. Davies.”</p>

<p>“Davies was an invalid. How did he get up
these stairs?”</p>

<p>“With difficulty, sir. I used to help him up, and
sometimes Mr. Audley helped me,” was the ex-butler’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
reply. “At poker he was marvelous. I’ve
seen poker played in several families in whose service
I’ve been, but I never saw a finer player. He
was more like a professional than an ordinary player
for amusement.”</p>

<p>“And your tenant, Mr. Audley?”</p>

<p>“He was a fine player, of course. He used to
have friends in at night and sometimes they would
play till dawn.”</p>

<p>“And did Mr. Graydon never play?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Very seldom; the parties usually took place when
he was away.”</p>

<p>It was quite evident that Stanley Audley, alias
Graydon, was a person of mystery and his friends
were as mysterious as himself. After a moment’s
reflection I decided to take Belton fully into my
confidence and tell him the whole story.</p>

<p>“Now, look here, Belton,” I said, “you may be
able to help me considerably. I will tell you the
whole story so far as I know it, and perhaps you
will be able to remember further facts that may
help.”</p>

<p>So I related to him everything that had happened
since I first met Stanley Audley and his bride
at Mürren.</p>

<p>Belton listened in silence. When I had finished
he asked me one or two questions.</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” he said at last, “I think you had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
better see my wife. She may know something
more.”</p>

<p>He fetched Mrs. Belton and briefly outlined to
her the facts I had given him.</p>

<p>“You see, Ada,” he said, “the gentleman who
called himself Audley here, was not the Mr. Audley
who married the daughter of Commander Shaylor.
Mr. Graydon is her husband. Isn’t it a puzzle?”</p>

<p>“It is,” replied his wife. Then, after I had made
my explanation I begged her to tell me any further
fact which might be of service in my inquiry. She
hesitated for a moment and at last said:</p>

<p>“Don’t you recollect, Jack, that Mr. Graydon, before
he came to us, lived at Seton’s, in Lancaster
Gate. He was very friendly with Mr. Seton, who
you remember was butler to old Lord Kenhythe at
Kenhythe, in Kirkcudbrightshire. You went there
one shooting season from Shawcross Castle, to
oblige his lordship.”</p>

<p>“Oh! yes, of course!” exclaimed her husband.
“Really, Ada, you’ve a long memory!”</p>

<p>“Well, I was head-housemaid once at Shawcross
Castle. You forget that! But, don’t you recollect
that young Mr. Graydon was very friendly with Mr.
Seton. I don’t know why he left there and came to
us, but I fancy it was because there was such a row
at a party he had there, and he wouldn’t apologize,
or something like that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>“Ah! I remember it all now, of course, Ada,”
exclaimed the woman’s husband. “Yes, you’re right—perfectly
right! If there’s one man in London
who knows about Mr. Graydon it’s Mr. Seton.”</p>

<p>He gave me the address of Lord Kenhythe’s ex-butler,
and an hour later I called at a large private
hotel facing Hyde Park, near Lancaster Gate, with
a scribbled card from Belton.</p>

<p>The man who received me was a tall, very urbane
person with small side-whiskers. He took me into
his private parlor in the basement, where I told
him the object of my visit.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I know Mr. Philip Graydon. A very
estimable young gentleman.”</p>

<p>“Who is he?”</p>

<p>“Well, his father was the great Clyde shipbuilder,
whose works are at Port Glasgow—the firm of
Graydon and Hambling. When his father died,
about two years ago, he left him a quarter of a
million.”</p>

<p>“You know him well?”</p>

<p>“I did, sir. His father used to shoot with his
lordship regularly, and Mr. Philip often came with
him.”</p>

<p>I briefly told him that I was making inquiries into
certain very curious circumstances, and said—</p>

<p>“I want your private opinion, Mr. Seton. Is
there anything peculiar concerning Mr. Graydon?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
I ask this because on his marriage he took the name
of Audley.”</p>

<p>“His marriage! I didn’t know he’d married,
sir.”</p>

<p>“Yes. And he is missing. It is on behalf of his
wife, who is a friend of mine, that I’m making
these inquiries.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Graydon married!” he repeated. “Pardon
me, sir, but whom did he marry?”</p>

<p>“A young lady named Shaylor.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” he ejaculated. “Yes, I know. He was
very fond of her—very fond! Her mother is a
widow in very straitened circumstances, I’ve heard.
But do you say he’s missing?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He disappeared while they were on their
honeymoon in Switzerland.”</p>

<p>“And where is his wife now?”</p>

<p>“With her mother in Bexhill. But tell me, Mr.
Seton, Mr. Graydon as you call him, was with you
for some months, wasn’t he?”</p>

<p>“For nearly a year and a half, sir.”</p>

<p>“And during that time did a man named Audley
ever visit him?”</p>

<p>“Yes, a round-faced man who lived at Belton’s.
He visited Mr. Graydon first about six weeks before
he left me to go and live at Belton’s.”</p>

<p>“Why did he leave you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>“Well, he had a bachelor party one night—they
were very noisy and I remonstrated with him, and—well,
he’s only young, sir—and the fact is he
insulted me. So I gave him notice. But we’re still
the best of friends,” said the ex-butler.</p>

<p>And then Seton sprang on me perhaps the greatest
surprise of my life.</p>

<p>“Now I know your reason for wanting to see Mr.
Graydon,” he said. “I may as well tell you he is
here now.”</p>

<p>“Here!” I gasped excitedly, “do you mean he is
staying here?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” was the reply, “he’s in number eighteen.
He came here yesterday quite unexpectedly.”</p>

<p>At last I had run Thelma’s mysterious husband to
earth!</p>

<p>“He came in half-an-hour ago,” Seton went on,
“and I gave him a letter which came for him by
express messenger. I know he’s upstairs. If you
would like to see him, I will send up.”</p>

<p>“No, thanks,” I said. “Under the circumstances
I think I would prefer to go up unannounced if you
have no objection.”</p>

<p>“Not in the least,” replied Seton. “Number
Eighteen is on the second floor.”</p>

<p>So I eagerly ascended the wide, thickly-carpeted
stairs. I had no very clear idea as to how I should
approach the man I had known as Stanley Audley,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
but I was determined to demand an adequate explanation
of why he had married Thelma under an
assumed name and so cruelly deserted her, and, if
necessary, to back my demand by a threat of legal
proceedings.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

<small>IN ROOM NUMBER EIGHTEEN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the second landing I rapped at the door of
room Number 18, feeling considerable pleasure at
the thought of giving my whilom friend an unwelcome
surprise.</p>

<p>There was no reply, but I fancied I heard a movement
inside. I listened eagerly.</p>

<p>I knocked again. Yes. I felt sure someone was
within, but my knock met with no response.</p>

<p>A third time I knocked and more loudly, but to
no avail. I tried the door—it was locked.</p>

<p>Five times I hammered with my fist, but there
being no answer I descended the stairs and found
Mr. Seton.</p>

<p>“But he must be up there if his door is locked,”
he said. “He never takes his key but always leaves
it on the peg here,” and he indicated a board on the
wall in a little box-like room off the hall where visitors
left their keys. To each key was attached a
bulky ball of wood, in order that the key should
not be carried away accidentally in the pocket.</p>

<p>With the landlord I reascended the stairs and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
Seton knocked at the door, calling his guest by
name. But there was still no response.</p>

<p>“Do you know, I believe I heard somebody inside
when I first knocked,” I remarked.</p>

<p>Seton bent and peered through the keyhole.</p>

<p>“At any rate the door is locked on the inside,”
he said.</p>

<p>Then he thundered at the door, after which we
both listened. There was no sound, but I thought
I detected the smell of burning paper.</p>

<p>All the other guests were apparently out at the
time, for the noise we made attracted only the
servants.</p>

<p>“Baker!” Seton cried to a man who was in his
shirtsleeves and wore an apron of green baize, “we
must force this door. There’s a crow-bar down in
the cellar. Go and get it.”</p>

<p>As the man addressed ran downstairs, the ex-butler
turned to me with a scared expression upon
his face, saying——</p>

<p>“This is very peculiar, sir. Why has he locked
himself in like this? Did you really hear a noise?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I am sure I did, yet with the roar of the
traffic out in the road, I really couldn’t quite swear
to it,” was my reply.</p>

<p>“What I heard was like a man bustling about hurriedly,
and yet trying to make no noise.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>“Surely he can’t have fainted--or--or committed
suicide!” Seton remarked.</p>

<p>For a few minutes we stood outside the door
utterly mystified, until the porter brought us a rusty
bar of iron about three feet long, curved and flattened
at the end—a very serviceable crow-bar.</p>

<p>This, Seton inserted between the door and the
jamb, close to the lock, and then drew it back slowly.
The woodwork groaned, creaked and cracked and
with a sudden jerk the wood round the mortice lock
tore away and the door flew open.</p>

<p>We stood amazed. The room was empty.</p>

<p>In a few seconds we had searched the big old-fashioned
wardrobe and had looked beneath the
bed and behind the curtains. But nobody was there.
And, moreover, while the key was still in the door
on the inside the window was closed and latched!</p>

<p>The fireplace was a small one with a flue through
which not even a small boy could pass. In the grate
were smoldering ashes of something, apparently
a coat that had been hastily burned. There was
an odor of consumed petrol, and it occurred to me
at once that some clothing had been hurriedly saturated
from a bottle of motor-spirit and set fire to—for
the room was still heavy with smoke.</p>

<p>Seton crossed to the window and saw at once
that it had not been opened. I glanced out and
down. From the narrow window-sill there was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
sheer drop to the paved basement forty or fifty
feet below with not even a stackpipe by which an
active man might have escaped.</p>

<p>“Well, this is extraordinary,” cried Seton. “How
could Mr. Graydon possibly get out of the room
and leave it still locked on the inside?”</p>

<p>Seton bent suddenly over the fireplace. “Well,
we may as well see what he was burning,” he said
as he picked up a half charred piece of paper that
had apparently been crumpled up hastily and thrown
into the grate. He smoothed it out and looked at
it in amazement.</p>

<p>It was a portion of a fifty-pound Bank of England
note! It was partly burned but quite enough was
left to identify it without any possibility of a mistake.</p>

<p>“Well,” I exclaimed, “burning fifty-pound notes
is certainly a new kind of pastime. What on earth
can it mean?”</p>

<p>“I can’t imagine,” replied Seton. “And how can
Mr. Graydon have gone? Certainly not through
the door or the window.”</p>

<p>“And before he went,” I added, “he burnt a coat
or something of the kind and a fifty-pound note!”</p>

<p>In front of the window was a small early Victorian
escritoire. Upon it were several loose sheets
of paper from a new writing-pad, an ink-stained
envelope, and a couple of bills from a local chemist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>Seton opened two or three of the drawers and 
from one of them drew a folded wad of papers.
“More notes!” he ejaculated, as he felt with his
fingers the crisp familiar crackle.</p>

<p>There were three notes for fifty pounds each,
obviously quite new. Clearly Graydon, in his hurry,
had forgotten that they were there.</p>

<p>“It seems to me,” I said to Seton, “that Graydon
must have been frightened by something and had
to get away quickly.”</p>

<p>“Frightened, but of what?” Seton asked. “I saw
him only half-an-hour before you came, and he
seemed all right then.”</p>

<p>“Do you think my visit might have frightened
him?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I don’t know. But why did he burn
a fifty-pound note and how did he get out? That’s
what puzzles me. I could have understood it if
he had locked his door on the outside.”</p>

<p>“It beats me, anyhow,” I said, looking round
the room. I noticed Graydon’s two suitcases stood
open and some of his clothes were hanging in the
wardrobe. Why, and above all how had he vanished
so suddenly? But for the fact that he had
actually called to see me—showing that he certainly
was not afraid of meeting me—I might well
have thought that he would be alarmed on recognizing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
my voice. But he had evidently not done so
and must have thought I was someone else whom
he urgently desired to avoid.</p>

<p>Those fifty-pound notes puzzled Lord Kenhythe’s
ex-butler as completely as they did myself. Men
do not usually go about burning fifty-pound notes.
We knew that the young fellow who, in Switzerland,
had posed as a hard-working electrical engineer
welcoming the prospect of a “rise,” was on the contrary,
a rich young man. But that he should burn
bank-notes of such value or leave them discarded
as he had done, was simply inexplicable on any
hypothesis we could frame.</p>

<p>I was deeply chagrined. I had come within an
ace of capturing the truant bridegroom and yet he
had eluded me. Could it really, I asked myself,
have been the same man? Again I carefully described
to Seton the man I had known as Stanley
Audley. He was emphatic in his assertion that it
was Philip Graydon, the man who had been in
that very room barely half-an-hour before. And
as if to make assurance doubly sure, I found on one
of his suitcases a label of the Kürhaus Hotel at
Mürren and another put on at Mürren station, registering
this case through to Victoria.</p>

<p>There could not be the slightest doubt as to the
mystery man’s identity as Thelma’s husband.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>“Look here!” said Seton, suddenly, as he held up
a towel he had taken from the rail. It was stained
with blood. The hand basin was half full of water
deeply tinged with blood.</p>

<p>“Evidently he had cut himself badly,” was Seton’s
comment.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” I said, “but is this his own blood or
someone else’s?”</p>

<p>“Surely, sir, you don’t suspect he has been guilty
of a crime?” gasped Seton.</p>

<p>I pointed to the charred fragments of the coat.
“It might be so,” I rejoined.</p>

<p>A few moments later, however, on making a
closer search of the room we found in the waste-paper
basket a broken medicine bottle and on the
edge of a piece of glass was a blood stain. It told
its own tale—he had cut his hand upon the glass.
Further, close beside the dressing-table were three
or four dark spots. I touched one, and found it to
be blood.</p>

<p>“I wonder why he destroyed his coat?” Seton
remarked. “He’s gone away leaving everything
behind.”</p>

<p>“But how did he get out?” I persisted. “The
door and window were both fastened and there is
no fanlight.”</p>

<p>We again carefully examined the lock. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
intact, it had been locked from the inside and the
key was still there.</p>

<p>Together we went carefully through the fugitive’s
belongings, but found nothing of interest. They
were merely clothes of good quality or the wardrobe
of a fashionable young man. From the pocket
of the suitcase that bore the label “B. O. B.”—or
Bernese Oberland Bahn—I took out three one-pound
Treasury notes. But we found not a scrap
of writing of any sort. There was some burnt paper
in the fireplace, suggesting that with the coat he
had destroyed all documents that might give a clue
to his identity. The broken bottle smelt of petrol
and apparently he had kept the spirit ready for use
if he wanted quickly to destroy anything.</p>

<p>Our search concluded, Seton had all the things
removed to an unoccupied room and locked the door.</p>

<p>“The Bank will pay the halfnote,” said Seton.
“I shall pay the lot in and hold the money until Mr.
Graydon turns up again. He has plenty of money,
of course, and may not have missed it. There is
no doubt some explanation. I cannot believe, knowing
Mr. Graydon as I did, that there can be anything
very seriously wrong.”</p>

<p>“But why should the note be burned?” I queried.</p>

<p>“It might have been accidentally among the other
papers he destroyed, sir. Don’t you think so?”</p>

<p>This, of course, was possible. For a long time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
we sat in Seton’s room discussing the strange affair.
At first Seton thought he ought to tell the police,
but I urged him not to do so. It would get into
the papers, I argued, and that was the last thing
desirable for a high-class private hotel such as his.
I did not want a public scandal that must involve
Thelma in most unpleasant publicity.</p>

<p>“I wonder whether he had an inkling that you’d
called, sir?” suggested Seton. “Perhaps he saw
you from one of the front windows and then rushed
up and prepared to bolt.”</p>

<p>“But why should he? I have acted towards him
only as a friend and I see no reason why he should
take such extreme steps to avoid me. Besides, he
actually called at my flat.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I had forgotten that,” Seton admitted.
“But still, I think something must have frightened
him—and frightened him badly, too. He wouldn’t
have cut his hand in opening the bottle of petrol,
burned his clothes and papers, and got away so
swiftly if there wasn’t some very strong motive for
doing so. What’s your opinion?”</p>

<p>“The same as yours, Seton,” I answered. “But
the affair is full of remarkable circumstances. How
did he get out of that locked room? He was certainly
in there when I first knocked.”</p>

<p>“My own belief,” said Seton, “is that he must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
have started to destroy his things as soon as you
knocked. He was certainly in a great hurry for
he smashed the neck of the petrol bottle when he
found he could not get the cork out—it’s still in
the neck of the broken bottle—and cut his hand in
doing so.”</p>

<p>“But there wouldn’t have been time,” I said, impatiently.</p>

<p>“I think so,” said Seton. “The coat was a light
one and saturated with petrol, it would burn very
quickly. You stood at the door probably for ten
minutes before you called me and it was certainly
another quarter of an hour, or even more, before
I forced the door. That coat would burn in that
time.”</p>

<p>“Yes, perhaps, but that doesn’t explain how he
got away from the locked room, or where he
went to.”</p>

<p>Lord Kenhythe’s ex-butler shrugged his broad
shoulders and with a mystified look upon his clean-shaven
face, replied—</p>

<p>“How he got out, sir, and where he has gone to,
is to me a complete mystery. But I feel sure he’ll
come back, or he’ll write and tell me about it. Besides,
he’s not a gentleman to leave without settling
his bill.”</p>

<p>“Well,” I said, laughing, “you won’t lose much.
He’s left you two hundred odd pounds.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>I left, promising to call again on the following
afternoon. This I did, eager to know whether he
had any further news of his missing guest.</p>

<p>As I entered the room, I saw that the man’s face
was graver and more puzzled than before.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Seton?” I asked. “What’s happened?”</p>

<p>“Happened, sir. Those bank-notes. When I
took them to the bank this morning the manager
called me into his room and questioned me very
closely. They’re forgeries!”</p>

<p>“Forged notes!” I gasped, staring at him.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. The manager told me that all banks
here and abroad had been warned about six months
ago that a quantity of spurious five and fifty-pound
Bank of England notes were in circulation. They’ve
been printed in Argentina. The police made a raid
on the factory, seized the printing press and plates
and six men were arrested. All of them have been
sent to prison for long terms, but at the trial it came
out that they were in league with certain confederates
in Paris, Madrid and London who were engaged
in circulating them—mostly the five-pound
ones.”</p>

<p>“And what did you say?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I told the whole story. The manager
took the notes, and I believe he’s sent them to the
Bank of England.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>“Then the police will start inquiries!” I cried,
dismayed, for the situation was becoming daily more
complicated.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” he replied. “I understood from the
manager that they will!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>

<small>LOVE VS. HONOR</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Here</span> was a new and extraordinary complication.</p>

<p>Why was Stanley Audley, alias Philip Graydon,
in possession of forged notes from the notorious
factory in South America? Why had he attempted
to destroy one of them, while leaving the others in
a drawer?</p>

<p>In the hope, though it was but faint, of getting
further information about Audley, I telephoned
to Marigold Day and asked her to dine with me at
the Piccadilly Hotel.</p>

<p>She promptly accepted, and during the meal I
brought the talk round to Audley, telling her of his
remarkable disappearance from the room in Seton’s
Hotel in Lancaster Gate.</p>

<p>“But are you really certain it was Mr. Audley?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“Quite,” I replied. “Seton’s description of him
bears no possible room for doubt. Besides, he had
known Audley for a long time and there is no possibility
that he can have made a mistake.”</p>

<p>“It is an extraordinary thing if he has been in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
London that he did not let me know,” she said,
frowning and evidently puzzled.</p>

<p>“Yes, that is so, but we have to remember that
for some unaccountable reason he seems to have
decided to completely efface himself.”</p>

<p>“Harold Ruthen believes that he is hiding in
Paris,” she said.</p>

<p>“But from whom should he be hiding, and why?”
I questioned. “Do you think that he can possibly
be hiding from the police?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what to think,” she replied with
a sigh, “but why do you suggest the police.”</p>

<p>“Well,” I answered, “I think you ought to know
that a very strange thing happened at Lancaster
Gate. When we searched the room we found in the
grate a half-burned Bank of England fifty-pound
note. In a drawer were three others. And all of
them have been found to be forgeries.”</p>

<p>“Ah, then you know,” said the girl with a queer,
hard look that I had never seen in her eyes before.</p>

<p>“That is all I know,” I said, “and I wondered
whether you could tell me any more. Is it on account
of these forged notes that he is hiding? It
certainly looks very like it, and I have no doubt
whatever that that will be the view of the police.
What does Ruthen say?”</p>

<p>“He hasn’t told me anything, but I remember
one queer incident. Once when we were out together<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
he paid for supper with a five-pound note and
we were about to go out when the manager of the
restaurant came back and declared it to be a forgery.
Stanley apologized profusely, and gave the man another
in its place, explaining that he had cashed a
cheque at his club and they had given it to him with
four others. Apparently the others he had were
genuine. I did not think much of it at the time—such
a thing, of course, might easily have happened—but
after what you have told me I don’t know
what to believe.”</p>

<p>It was difficult to believe that the young fellow
who had married Thelma and for whom I had
formed a genuine liking, could be the ally of a gang
of bank-note forgers, yet the evidence was becoming
overwhelming.</p>

<p>“But I thought you told me Audley was well off,”
I said. “Well-to-do people don’t usually descend
to dealing in forged notes.”</p>

<p>“He always appeared to be,” was Marigold’s
reply, “but possibly that was how he made his money.
As a matter of fact I really did not know very much
about him. I met him through intimate friends and
I suppose I more or less took him for granted. He
was quite obviously a gentleman and one can’t enquire
closely into the antecedents of every man
one meets.”</p>

<p>I wondered whether the girl had in some way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
stumbled upon the truth. If this were the case, the
shock of finding that the man she undoubtedly was
beginning to love was involved in such infamous
practices as the passing of forged notes would be
quite sufficient to explain the strange change Mrs.
Powell had noticed and commented on. It was quite
clear, from what Mrs. Powell had said, that she had
suffered some blow which had utterly upset her. On
the other hand, the knowledge that Audley had married
Thelma would have been an equally satisfactory
explanation.</p>

<p>In answer to a question, Marigold told me she
had seen Ruthen at Rector’s Club three nights before
and had chatted with him. He had then told
her that he was still in search of Stanley and that
he had been looking for him in Paris. But, although
she had questioned him, he would not tell her his
motives.</p>

<p>We went to a revue together and later I saw her
into a taxi on her way home. Though I questioned
her as closely as I could, and she seemed quite willing
to help, she could not, or would not, tell me any
more.</p>

<p>I walked home to Russell Square utterly bewildered
and spent a sleepless night racking my brain
for a solution of the mystery. Here we were in
April and so far as I could tell I was as far off as
ever from finding the key to the enigma.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>I decided next day to take my partner, Hensman,
fully into my confidence. He was five years older
than I, and a keen, practical business man for whose
judgment I had considerable respect.</p>

<p>He heard me in silence. At first he was inclined
to be amused but as I went on his thin, clean-shaven
face assumed a very serious expression.</p>

<p>“Well,” I asked when I had finished, “what do
you think of it all?”</p>

<p>“Intensely interesting, Rex—but extremely complicated,”
was my partner’s reply, as he sat back in
his chair. “On the face of it Audley is a crook
hiding from the police. Evidently he has not attempted
to get abroad, but is still somewhere in
London. That’s my view.”</p>

<p>“But what causes his wife to tell me that he can
never return to her?” I asked. “What is your opinion
of that?”</p>

<p>“I cannot tell that. But I believe she must hear
from him and that she knows his whereabouts from
time to time. The telegram he received calling him
back from Mürren was, no doubt, a message of
warning.”</p>

<p>“I quite agree,” I said. “But why did he escape
so rapidly from Lancaster Gate?”</p>

<p>“Probably he thought you were a detective.”</p>

<p>“But if he saw me enter the place he would have
recognized me at once.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>“True. I never thought of that,” said Hensman.
“No. He took fright at something, and thought
he’d destroy all the bank-notes. His escape, I admit,
was an ingenious one. He evidently slipped out
while you had gone downstairs to call Seton, and
leaving the key on the inside of the door, re-locked
it.”</p>

<p>“How could he?”</p>

<p>“If the end of the key protruded, as it does in
many cases, it would be quite easy to turn with a
pair of pincers,” Hensman replied. “If he is a
crook he most probably carries a pair, for by that
means locked doors are frequently opened by
thieves.”</p>

<p>This explanation, simple though it was, appeared
perfectly adequate and I was chagrined that neither
Seton nor myself had hit upon it. Later, when I
again examined the door, I had no doubt at all
about it. The end of the key projected beyond the
surface of the door and as the lock was well-oiled
and went very easily, it was easy, I found, to turn
the key from the outside with a pair of pliers.</p>

<p>It was clear that Audley had been alarmed by
something, whether it was my knock at his door that
had disturbed him, we could not tell. Whatever it
was, he had evidently slipped out when he heard me
walk away from the door, locked the door behind
him and hidden in one of the other rooms. Then his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
movements, masked by the noise made in breaking
open the door, he had calmly walked out and disappeared.</p>

<p>“My advice, Rex, is to have nothing further to
do with the affair,” my partner argued. “Leave it
all severely alone. There is no sort of reason why
you should allow yourself to be dragged into any
police-court business. Suppose Audley is arrested,
as no doubt he will be eventually, then you’ll be
called for the prosecution. And you don’t want
that.”</p>

<p>I demurred. It was the same advice that old
Feng had given me. And yet, try how I could, I
could not bring myself to desert Thelma in her distress.</p>

<p>Three days later I received a note from her from
the Hotel Reubens, in Buckingham Palace Road,
saying that her mother and she were staying there
for a few days and asking whether I could see her.</p>

<p>I called that evening, and was invited to stay to
dinner. She was very charming, but I saw she was
pale and anxious. She seemed overwrought and
nervous, her slim fingers ever fidgeting with her
wedding ring.</p>

<p>After dinner we were taking coffee in the lounge
when Thelma, seeing a girl she knew, rose and left
us to speak to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>“Well, Mrs. Shaylor,” I asked quickly, “has
Thelma had any further news of her husband?”</p>

<p>“Not a word,” was the reply. “But several times
a man, a stranger to me, has been to see her, and
they have gone out together. His name, I believe,
is Ruthen or Ruthven.”</p>

<p>“Harold Ruthen! He was at Mürren.”</p>

<p>“So I believe. But he seems to pester her to
death,” replied her mother. “Each time he comes
she seems very upset, and I know she cries bitterly
after he has gone. He seems to hold some extraordinary
hold over her, but she will not say anything
about it.”</p>

<p>“She does not like him?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. She always receives him gladly.
But she may not feel what she pretends.”</p>

<p>“Curious if that fellow really has some hold over
her,” I said, recollecting that strange conversation
in the night at Mürren. “My opinion is that Thelma
is in fear of him, and in order to cloak her fear from
you she pretends to welcome him, whereas his presence
is really hateful to her.”</p>

<p>“You think so?” asked the widow, stirring her
coffee and looking straight into my face. “All she
has told me is that the man is a friend of her husband’s.”</p>

<p>“I believe that is true,” was my reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>“And he is in search of Stanley, just as you are,
Mr. Yelverton,” she added.</p>

<p>I drew a long breath, but made no reply, for at
that instant Thelma rejoined us, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“Only fancy, mother, I haven’t seen Sybil Deighton
since I left school. And now she’s married.
That’s her husband she’s with. Rather a nice boy,
isn’t he?”</p>

<p>And she threw herself into the lounge-chair next
to me.</p>

<p>Not until an hour later when Mrs. Shaylor had
bidden us good-night and we had retired into one
of the cosy corners that I ventured to speak of
Stanley.</p>

<p>“No, Mr. Yelverton,” she said shaking her beautiful
head sadly, and raising her big gray eyes to
mine. “I have heard nothing—not a word. If
Stanley is still alive he would surely send me a reassuring
word. I—I begin to think that he must
be dead!”</p>

<p>Stanley Audley dead! If that were so I should be
free to love her and to win her if I could. The
very thought caused my heart to leap. I even found
myself cherishing the wish that it might be true.
Yet a moment later I began to despise myself for
entertaining such an unworthy thought. It was not
“playing the game” according to the right traditions
of the school in which I had been brought up. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
so far, at any rate, I had tried to conform to the
code of personal honor that, with many men, is a
far more powerful rule of conduct than most forms
of religious belief.</p>

<p>Though I led the conversation several times in
the direction of Harold Ruthen, Thelma said nothing
of his visits to Bexhill. I was irritated because
she would not be frank with me. At length I thought
it would be best to speak plainly and told her of my
adventure in Lancaster Gate, of course without mentioning
the discovery of the forged bank-notes.</p>

<p>“But, surely it could not have been Stanley!” she
exclaimed excitedly. “Why should he want to avoid
you, of all men? He could not imagine you as
anything else but a friend!”</p>

<p>“Equally so, why does he not let you know his
whereabouts?” I asked in turn.</p>

<p>She shook her head in dismay.</p>

<p>Then suddenly, with an expression of despair in
her eyes, she put out her thin white hand with the
wedding ring upon it, and pointing to it, said in a
low voice—</p>

<p>“Think what—what a mockery this is to me!”</p>

<p>What could I reply? Here was a girl not yet
twenty, married only a few days and then deserted.
Her distress was very real and very pitiful. It had
been on the tip of my tongue to tax her with her
concealment from me of Ruthen’s visits, but in view<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
of what she was suffering I could not bring myself
to pain her further. Either she loved her husband,
in spite of his apparently callous desertion of her,
or, for some inexplicable reason she was playing a
part with a skill that many an actress would envy.</p>

<p>More and more I was tortured by my growing
love for her. Hitherto I had kept it within bounds,
and, so far as I knew, I had never—intentionally, at
any rate—given a hint of it to Thelma herself. But
as I look back, I can see now that such a restraint
could not be maintained. A crash was bound to
come. It came, very swiftly and very suddenly a
few days later.</p>

<p>Thelma and her mother had promised to come
and have tea with me in my rooms at Russell Square.
At the last moment Mrs. Shaylor was called to Watford
to see her sister who had been taken ill, and
Thelma came alone. She was in comparatively good
spirits and after my old housekeeper had served us
with tea, we spent a couple of delightful hours.
Thelma, an accomplished musician, sang to me, accompanying
herself on my piano, and as I sat watching
and listening to her I realized more fully than
ever how handsome and lovable she was and my
anger against Stanley Audley became almost unbearable.</p>

<p>“Poor mother!” she exclaimed presently as she
re-seated herself by the fire, after singing a gay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
song from one of the latest revues, “She’s awfully
worried. That’s why we are up in town. The
securities which my father left are depreciating in
value, and one of the companies in which he invested
most of his money has now gone into liquidation.
She came up to see my uncle, who is her trustee.
Yes, Mr. Yelverton, the war spelt ruin to us,
as it did to so many others, and yet the Stock Exchange
speculators made fortunes out of it—out of
lives of men.”</p>

<p>It was sad news she had told me, but I had not
been blind to the fact that Mrs. Shaylor was, like
so many other gentlewomen of today, keeping up
a brave appearance, with but small funds at her
disposal.</p>

<p>I longed to mention Harold Ruthen, but did not
dare to do so lest I should betray what her mother
had told me in confidence. But I was angry that
the fellow dared to seek her at Bexhill and cause her
worry. It, however, proved one fact, that he, at
any rate, was not aware of Stanley’s whereabouts,
and, for the moment, could not do him the harm
that I believe he fully intended.</p>

<p>How one’s most momentous actions depend at
times upon the merest trivialities! I little guessed
that a trifle was to rouse in me a gust of emotion
destined to sweep away the last vestige of the iron
self-control I had honestly tried to set upon myself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>Thelma was the wife of another man: that fact
I had tried to keep always before my mind. I was
to learn now that there are, in each one of us, forces
too strong to be enchained by any man-made codes
of conduct.</p>

<p>Thelma had seated herself in a low chair and was
gazing sadly into the fire. Either her gaiety had
been a pretense or the thought of her unhappy position
had again overcome her.</p>

<p>“It’s very hard lines on you, Thelma,” I said
softly.</p>

<p>She made no reply, but her eyes filled suddenly
with tears. She put out her hand as if in acknowledgment
of my sympathy and I took it in mine.</p>

<p>Its touch seemed to pour liquid fire through every
pore of my being. I forgot all my good resolutions,
all my pride of tradition and, in a second, I was
kneeling beside her, pouring out a flood of impassioned
words. What I said I have not the faintest
idea. I was beside myself in a passion of love that
broke all bounds and defied restraint.</p>

<p>Thelma rose quickly from her chair, crossed the
room to the window and, burying her face in her
hands, burst into a torrent of tears.</p>

<p>That brought me to my senses. I saw, too late,
how unutterably foolish I had been. How utterly inexcusable
was my conduct. Yet I had no regrets;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
rather I was thrilled with a savage joy that she
should know the truth at last.</p>

<p>“Stanley had no right to leave you as he has
done, without cause, or explanation after a few days
only of marriage!” I cried. “It is harsh and cruel.
It is not the act of a man of honor.”</p>

<p>But she held up her hand as though to stay my
further words.</p>

<p>“I—I’m sorry I came here, Mr. Yelverton,” she
said, suddenly, quite earnest and calm. “I thank
you for all your efforts on my behalf but I think we
must not meet in the future.”</p>

<p>“Then you still love the scoundrel who has deserted
you!” I cried, unable to restrain myself.</p>

<p>“I will have no word said against him,” she replied
gently. “Perhaps, after all, we have misjudged
him. It is time I went back to the Hotel.
Mother is taking me to see some friends tonight,
and—and we return to Bexhill tomorrow.”</p>

<p>That last sentence was equivalent to telling me
not to call again upon her.</p>

<p>“Why, I thought you were here for some days,”
I exclaimed in dismay.</p>

<p>“I think mother has decided to return tomorrow,”
was her significant reply.</p>

<p>I saw her home to Buckingham Palace Road and
there bade her farewell, cursing myself for my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
frantic outburst. I had acted like a fool. Yet the
regret I knew I ought to feel would not come.</p>

<p>Next morning among my letters on the breakfast
table was one addressed in typewriting, which I instantly
recognized. It was from Hammersmith,
having been sent by express messenger instead of
being posted as the other had been.</p>

<p>I recognized the uneven typing—and tore it open.
The words I read were:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Will you never take warning! You yesterday entertained
Stanley Audley’s wife at your rooms. As you have
disregarded the caution already given you, the consequences
will be upon your own head. If you value your life, you
will relinquish the search for a man who is already dead.
To continue is at your own peril. This is the last warning——”</p>
</div>

<p>I had a new and insistent problem to face. Who
was my mysterious correspondent and why was he
sufficiently interested to threaten me with death in
case I refused to abandon my search for Stanley
Audley?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>

<small>STRANGE SUSPICIONS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Try</span> as I would I could not dismiss from my mind
that old Doctor Feng, if he was not actually the
writer of the strange warnings I had received, was
in some way associated with the sender.</p>

<p>But what possible motive could he have? I could
see none. I had no sort of reason for thinking that
he had any interest in Stanley Audley and did not
want him discovered, or that he had the smallest
antipathy to me personally: in fact he had invariably
been extremely friendly. I had, it was true, sensed
a kind of latent hostility to Thelma, but this appeared
to be due more to the idea that I might make
a fool of myself, rather than to any active dislike
of her. And I could see no kind of reason why he
should attempt to scare me by means of an anonymous
letter. Yet the suspicion stuck in my mind
and refused to be dismissed.</p>

<p>Could the sender be Stanley Audley himself? Was
he alive, yet for some reason unable to come forward
openly? He might have learnt something,
and suspected more, of my friendship with Thelma,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
and, in a fit of jealousy, taken this means of trying
to put a stop to it. This was a possibility I could
not ignore, yet I never, for a moment, really believed
it. On the other hand, I could not imagine
anyone who could possibly feel towards me the
rancorous hate betrayed by the sending of the letters.</p>

<p>I had worked myself into such a state that any
real concentration upon business had become impossible
and at length my partner, quite justifiably,
took a strong line.</p>

<p>I had been engaged on an important right-of-way
case in Derbyshire. A committee of villagers had
begun an action against a local Council and I had
been preparing instruction for the defense. Exasperated
and distracted by the evil shadow that had
fallen across my life I was bungling the business
badly and at length had to turn it all over to
Hensman.</p>

<p>“Really, Rex,” he said, impatiently, “this can’t go
on. I cannot possibly do the whole work of the
office.”</p>

<p>I handed him the second warning letter. He read
it slowly, frowning deeply the while.</p>

<p>“My dear Rex,” he said, “this thing is getting
on your nerves. Cut it, old man. Go up to Cromer
and play golf for a week and think no more of the
girl, or the elusive bridegroom. Don’t mix yourself
up with the affair any more—unless—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>“Unless—yes, I know what you’re going to say.
Unless I’m in love with Thelma,” I replied. “She
has a suspicion—only a suspicion, that her husband
is dead.”</p>

<p>“And then?” he asked. “And then I suppose
you’d marry her—the widow of a crook—”</p>

<p>“How do we know he is a crook?” I asked. “We
have no proof of it.”</p>

<p>“Well, forged notes are pretty good evidence,
aren’t they?” asked my partner. “In any case you
are quite unfit for work and it isn’t fair on me—or
you, either, for that matter.”</p>

<p>“But who can be sending me these threatening
messages?” I asked him.</p>

<p>“Probably the wily husband himself. Wants a
divorce, possibly. Perhaps he will come to Hensman
&amp; Yelverton to file the petition!”</p>

<p>“You’re not serious!” I exclaimed pettishly.
“You don’t see what all this means to me—the upsetting
of my life and of my profession.”</p>

<p>“I’m perfectly serious, anyhow, in saying this
has got to end. We can’t go on with one partner
a passenger: things are getting behind. Cut the
whole affair. Your friend Feng, as any man of
sense would have been, was against it from the first.
And how about that old invalid from Constantinople?
Have you heard from him?”</p>

<p>“Not a word. That’s a reminder. I’ll write to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
the Ottoman Bank and see whether he is back
again. But I don’t see how he can help.”</p>

<p>“He was back in London three days ago. Look!”
Hensman said, passing me over a cutting from the
<i>Times</i>. “I cut it out intending to give it to you.”</p>

<p>I took the narrow little strip and read the words:</p>

<p>“Mr. Hartley Humphreys has returned from
Constantinople to the Carlton Hotel.”</p>

<p>“By Jove! I’ll call and see him,” I said. “The
paragraph escaped me. Thanks.”</p>

<p>“Well, Rex,—do be careful. This obsession
about your bride in distress is interfering seriously
with business. It’s all very well, but we—the firm—have
to get on and to live.”</p>

<p>His reproach, I felt, was amply justified. I
might have quarreled with another man in my
present state of mind, but Hensman and I had
been friends for many years and I had a real and
deep liking and respect for him. He was the last
man on earth with whom I could wish to quarrel.</p>

<p>“You’re quite right, old man,” I said at last. “It’s
not fair on you. I’ll try to pull myself together.
You don’t want us to part company?”</p>

<p>“Don’t be an ass, Rex,” he replied with a laugh.
“It isn’t so tragic as all that. But you are playing
with fire. Suppose Audley turns up all right? You
are getting yourself tied up in a hopeless knot and
my advice to you, once for all, is to cut yourself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
adrift from the whole business and have nothing
more to do with it. After all, Mrs. Audley is not
in actual want and whatever may have happened
at Mürren she has no shadow of claim on you any
further. Certainly there is no kind of reason why
you should run yourself into any danger for her
sake. I can’t help thinking that there is more behind
the matter than we know and that those letters
are meant seriously. If you were in any way
legitimately involved I would not suggest you should
show the white feather—indeed, I would come in
with you myself to the limit. But put the question
to yourself: is there any real reason, apart from
your infatuation for the girl—herself a married
woman, why you should continue to take a hand in
a very perplexing and unprofitable business. If we
knew Audley was dead and you are really fond of
the girl, it would be, I quite admit, a different
thing.”</p>

<p>I could not pretend that there was any flaw in
his logic. Yet I was still restless and dissatisfied.
I went home with him that night and dined with
his wife and himself in their quaint little cottage
home at Hampton. As I sat in that small low-pitched
room—for the house was composed of
two old-world cottages knocked into one—I envied
my partner his domestic happiness.</p>

<p>When I got back to Russell Square I sat down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
before the big fire old Mrs. Chapman had left me
and for the thousandth time went over the affair
from the beginning seeking to recall any trivial
circumstance that might throw some light upon it.
As to the personal threat, I recklessly made up
my mind that I would not allow it to influence me at
all: I would not run the risk of being fooled by a
practical joke on the one hand, or, on the other,
weakly run away if there were any real danger.</p>

<p>I decided that, in any case, I would see Dr. Feng,
show him the letters and, if necessary, ask him
bluntly whether he were the sender.</p>

<p>So at eleven o’clock next morning the maid at
the comfortable house in Barnes showed me into
the Doctor’s sitting-room, and a few seconds later
Feng, with a smile of welcome, entered with outstretched
hand.</p>

<p>“Well, Yelverton, so pleased to see you,” he
said, inviting me to a chair. “And how are things
going with you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, pretty much as usual,” I replied rather
moodily.</p>

<p>I hesitated a moment and then I took from my
pocket the second letter of warning.</p>

<p>“Look, Doctor,” I said, “I’ve received this.
What do you think of it?”</p>

<p>As he read it I watched him closely. It was evident
he was keenly interested. It struck me, too,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
that he was unmistakably surprised and my suspicion
that he might have been the writer faded
instantly.</p>

<p>“I wonder who could have sent you that?” he
exclaimed. “Somebody who is jealous of your attentions
to little Mrs. Audley.”</p>

<p>His eyes met mine, and I thought I saw a curious
look of mystery in them.</p>

<p>“I thought it possible that you might have been
the sender,” I said, with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Me!” he replied, starting. “Whatever causes
you to suspect that? Ah!” he added a second later.
“I notice the postmark is that of Hammersmith—just
across the bridge! No, my dear boy, I assure
you that I am not the sender.”</p>

<p>By his manner it was plain that he was telling the
truth.</p>

<p>“I remember your many warnings, Doctor. That
is why I suspected,” I said apologetically.</p>

<p>“Well, I hope you don’t believe that I’m guilty of
sending you such silly nonsense. Personally, if I
received such a letter I should take no notice of it.
You’re not alarmed, surely? It’s only some silly
joke, perpetrated, perhaps, by one of Audley’s mysterious
and undesirable associates.”</p>

<p>“I wish I knew whether Audley were alive or
dead!” I said bitterly. “His wife has heard that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
he is dead, yet I can find no evidence at all that this
is so.”</p>

<p>“She told you that he could never return to
her,” Feng remarked.</p>

<p>“Yes; but that is another puzzle upon which she
refused to throw any light,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Oh! by the way,” Feng exclaimed suddenly.
“You recollect old Hartley Humphreys at Mürren?
He wrote to me a few days ago and I went to dine
with him at the Carlton. He’s just back from Constantinople,
and do you know, his lameness is quite
cured. He’s been to some German specialist who
has put him right. He was enquiring about you.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to see him again,” I said. “He is quite
a pleasant old fellow.”</p>

<p>“Go and call. He’d like to see you, I’m sure.
He was interested in your romance, and asked me
how it had ended. I pretended ignorance, for I did
not know how much you would like him to learn.
I never care to obtrude in other people’s affairs.”</p>

<p>“I will certainly go and see him,” I said. “It’s
good news that he is cured.”</p>

<p>“Yes. He walks without a stick and seems rejuvenated.”</p>

<p>Next day I went to the Carlton and sent up my
card, after which I was conducted to a handsome
private sitting-room on the second floor. As I approached
the door, I saw disappearing along the corridor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
the back of a man whom I could have sworn
was Harold Ruthen. I recognized him mainly by
his walk, his grey felt hat, the well-cut brown suit
and the drab spats. But he had turned the corner
and disappeared before I could make sure.</p>

<p>In the room old Mr. Humphreys rose to meet me.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Yelverton! This is indeed a pleasure!
I was asking the Doctor about you only the
other day. I had mislaid your address. I’m so glad
you’ve called.”</p>

<p>“The Doctor told me you were here,” I said.</p>

<p>“Excellent! Sit down. Have one of these
Turkish cigarettes. They are real Turkish, for I
brought them home with me. You can get no first-class
Turkish cigarettes except in Turkey itself. As
you know, the export of the best tobacco leaves is
forbidden. The second quality only goes to
Europe.”</p>

<p>I took one of the thin little rolls of golden tobacco,
and lighting it pronounced it to be exquisite.</p>

<p>“Well, and what you have been doing since I left
Mürren—carrying on in your profession, I suppose?
And how about that charming little bride? Did her
husband come back?”</p>

<p>“No,” I replied. “He has not yet returned to
her.”</p>

<p>“What!” cried the old man, opening his eyes
widely. “Not back! Then he deserted her and left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
her upon your hands!” he added. “A rather
dangerous situation for a young man—eh?”</p>

<p>I smiled.</p>

<p>“It is a tragedy,” I said, a few moments later.
“The poor broken-hearted girl is back with her
mother at Bexhill.”</p>

<p>“And you see her sometimes, I expect.”</p>

<p>“Very rarely,” I answered. “But I am still seeking
for traces of the missing man.”</p>

<p>“Curious that he didn’t come back. He seemed
quite a nice young fellow and devoted to his wife.
There is a mystery somewhere. I wonder what
really happened.”</p>

<p>“It is impossible to conjecture—unless he is keeping
out of the way for some unexplained reason.”</p>

<p>A moment later the door opened and Dr. Feng
walked in. I was rather surprised at his coming up
unannounced. When he saw me he looked annoyed
for a moment, but only for a moment. Then he
laughed and said—</p>

<p>“Well, I didn’t expect to find you here, Yelverton!”</p>

<p>“We were discussing little Mrs. Audley and her
missing husband,” Humphreys explained.</p>

<p>“Yes, some silly ass who is jealous has sent Yelverton
two letters of warning, threatening him with
death if he continues his search for Audley or his
acquaintanceship with his wife,” the doctor said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>Humphreys laughed, and exclaimed—</p>

<p>“What rubbish! The letters must be a joke.”</p>

<p>“I think they are meant in earnest,” I said.</p>

<p>In the meantime the doctor had taken a chair before
the fire, and proceeded to light his pipe. It
struck me suddenly that, so far from being, as I had
believed, mere hotel acquaintances, these two were
great friends.</p>

<p>This surprised me. The doctor had told me that
he had made a formal call in response to a letter, but
as we sat there it was plain they were on terms of
close intimacy.</p>

<p>“I’ve had the agent round this morning about that
house in Hampstead I told you about,” Humphreys
said. “Ruthen is seeing after it for me. I fancy I
can get it a bit cheaper than they want. As I’ll be in
London for quite a year now, I prefer a house to
hotel life.”</p>

<p>Mention of the name of Ruthen caused me to
prick up my ears. I had no idea that the young man
who so constantly pestered Thelma with his questions
was acquainted with Humphreys.</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed the doctor. “I think you will be
better off in a house than in hotels. I always find the
latter very wearisome and restless.”</p>

<p>“It’s quite a nice place,” Humphreys remarked.
“A bit big perhaps, but I shall often have some relatives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
staying with me. Ruthen is quite of my opinion
that it would just suit me.”</p>

<p>“So he told me yesterday,” said the doctor. “I
met him at lunch with Andrews.”</p>

<p>Here was another surprise. I learned that three
men whom I had believed to be practically strangers
to each other were on terms of intimate friendship.</p>

<p>I remained for about an hour and then left the
pair together. Old Humphreys begged me to call
upon him again.</p>

<p>Two days later he rang me up at the office and
asked me to dine with him. I accepted and we had
dinner together in the Savoy restaurant, and afterwards
watched the dancing in the room below. The
old fellow, always a pleasant companion, had certainly
become rejuvenated since the winter at
Mürren.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it splendid!” he remarked when I referred
to his cure. “Old Professor Goltman, in Dresden,
has worked a miracle. I can now get about quite
well, and I feel quite twenty years younger.”</p>

<p>“You look it,” I declared, for he certainly seemed
an entirely different man from the decrepit invalid
who wheeled himself in his chair, and had often to
be carried upstairs.</p>

<p>Thoughts of Mürren reminded me that Harold
Ruthen had been there for a few days at the same
time as the invalid. Evidently they must have met<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
there and their acquaintance must have been renewed
in London, where Ruthen was now acting on
Humphreys’ behalf in regard to the house.</p>

<p>It struck me too, that if I mentioned Ruthen I
might be thought too inquisitive. But I decided to
watch closely, for I was beginning to grow distrustful
of both the doctor and his friend: of Ruthen I
had never been anything else. My suspicions were
greatly strengthened by a curious circumstance which
occurred about a week later.</p>

<p>Though I had struggled against it I had decided to
go down and see Thelma again, and put to her certain
other questions which I hoped would induce her
to give me her entire confidence. The fact was that
I could not keep away from her, try how I would.</p>

<p>I little dreamed of the consequences that visit was
to have!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br>

<small>SPUME OF THE STORM</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It was</span> evening when I alighted from the train at
the clean, spick-and-span little town of Bexhill, which
in summer and autumn is so animated, yet in spring
and winter is practically deserted.</p>

<p>Darkness had already fallen and a rough easterly
wind caused the leafless boughs of the trees to crack
and sway. A heavy gale was blowing in the Channel
that night and the boiling surf swept in upon the
shingle.</p>

<p>As I walked towards Bedford Avenue, that quiet
select thoroughfare of detached red-brick houses
which lies close to the sea, I noticed, on the opposite
side of the way, two persons—a man and a girl—walking
slowly in the direction which I was taking.</p>

<p>As they passed beneath a street-lamp, I had a
good view of them. It was Thelma walking with old
Doctor Feng!</p>

<p>I halted amazed, and instinctively drew back into
the shadow of a hedge which formed the boundary
of a garden. They were walking engrossed in conversation,
in the direction of Mrs. Shaylor’s house.</p>

<p>I had no idea that they were on terms of friendship,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
and their apparently clandestine meeting was a
complete surprise to me. Feng was bending to her,
talking earnestly in an undertone, while she appeared
to be listening attentively.</p>

<p>There flashed across my memory a moment in
Mürren when I had seen the Doctor and Ruthen
walking together in secret up a narrow snow-piled
lane, though we all believed they were strangers.
What could it possibly mean?</p>

<p>I allowed the pair to go ahead of me, following
them at a distance and watching.</p>

<p>I thought I heard the girl cry “No! No!” in a distressed
tone. But it might have been merely my
fancy.</p>

<p>They walked together very slowly until they
reached the corner of Bedford Avenue. Here they
halted, and again I drew back into the shadow.
From where I stood I could see them very plainly,
for a lamp shone full upon them. No other person
was in the vicinity. I could plainly see old Feng’s
face and beard as he spoke evidently in deep earnest,
while Thelma, wrapped in her smart squirrel coat
and wearing the little fur toque which I had
admired so much, stood listening.</p>

<p>Suddenly she appeared to utter some appeal.
But the old man shook his head relentlessly. He
had apparently told her something which had staggered
her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>I watched, scarcely daring to draw breath, in a
mist of uncertainty, jealousy and dread.</p>

<p>How long they stood there I could not say, but it
seemed a long time. I was utterly amazed at the
sight of Thelma keeping what was clearly a secret
appointment with this old fellow who had often
warned me against a dangerous friendship. Were
both of them, I wondered, in some plot to delude
and play with me. Was Thelma, after all, in league
with her husband and his mysterious friends. Was
old Feng for some sinister reason a member of the
same queer coterie?</p>

<p>At last he took her hand and held it in his for a
long time. Then he raised his hat and bade her farewell.
She seemed glad to get rid of his presence, for
she turned away and flew towards her mother’s
house at the seaward end of the silent road, while he
turned on his heel and strode in the direction of the
station.</p>

<p>Rather than go direct to Mrs. Shaylor’s I followed
the Doctor at a distance up the town until I
saw him hurry into the station yard. Here he had
unbuttoned his overcoat and glanced at his watch.
Evidently a train was due.</p>

<p>So I turned back, and a little later I opened the
garden gate, walked up the path and rang the bell.
“Jock,” Mrs. Shaylor’s Airedale barked loudly, and
in a few moments the neat maid opened the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>In the artistic little hall Thelma, who had divested
herself of coat and hat, came forward exclaiming
gladly—</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Yelverton! Whoever expected to see
you tonight? Come in. Mother is out at a friend’s
playing bridge, I think, and I am all alone.”</p>

<p>She helped me off with my coat, took my hat, and
ushered me into the charming drawing-room overlooking
the sea.</p>

<p>She switched on more lights and handed me her
cigarette case, then threw herself into a big chair before
the fire opposite me.</p>

<p>“Now, tell me what you’ve been doing,” she
asked. “It is a real surprise to see you tonight.”</p>

<p>She was, of course, ignorant that I knew of her
secret meeting with old Feng, and I felt annoyed and
mistrustful.</p>

<p>“Well,” I said, “I have very little news and none
of any importance. I came down hoping that you
might have something more to tell me. My only
news is that the other day I met another of our
friends—Mr. Hartley Humphreys. You remember
the old invalid at Mürren?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, of course. He often spoke to me—a
charming old boy. I recollect him perfectly. How
is he?”</p>

<p>“Better. His lameness is cured, and he’s quite
young again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>“And you have no other news for me,” she
remarked meaningly.</p>

<p>“You mean about Stanley. No—nothing,” I said
regretfully.</p>

<p>She sighed, and I saw again that hardening at the
corners of her mouth which seemed to come with
every mention of her husband.</p>

<p>As for myself, my brain was in a whirl: my good
resolutions, so easy to make when I was away from
her, vanished like smoke. At the same time the
suspicion I had felt when I saw her talking to Feng
in the dark, lonely road, melted like mist before the
sun. She was so frankly innocent and unspoiled;
there was about her no trace of coquetry or desire to
provoke admiration. The impression grew stronger
and stronger as we sat chatting freely in that pretty
drawing-room, with the roar of the sea and wind
sounding faintly through the curtained windows
that, whatever appearances might suggest, this child-bride
of a few days was actually alone—more hopelessly
alone in her wedded life than if she were in a
convent. I saw myself looking into the depths of a
soul unsullied, and for the first time, I truly believe,
I began to understand dimly some of the feelings and
desires that must be tearing at her heart.</p>

<p>“My husband can never return to me!” Over
and over again her significant sentence beat itself
upon my brain. I could not understand it—I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
not the key to the riddle it contained. Yet, for some
inexplicable reason it seemed to fill my mind with
hope, even though I knew that, so long as Stanley
Audley lived, my love for his wife could never be
more than a tormenting dream. Try to disguise it
how I would, the girl held me, for good or ill; she
had fascinated me utterly and completely, not by the
purposeful acts of the courtesan, but by her own
innate sweetness and modesty. What I had seen
that night puzzled me beyond measure, but in the
hour I spent with her I became assured that nothing
on earth could shake my conviction that in every
essential she was true and good and sweet. Time, I
felt, would solve the riddle sooner or later.</p>

<p>So I sat there, foolish and fascinated, unable to
bring myself to put any serious question to her for
fear of causing her sorrow or anxiety. I knew, I
felt, that I was indeed walking upon thin ice, that my
honor was wearing thin. Yet, I realized that
Thelma was not as many other women are, and I
dared not again allow the feelings that ran riot in
my heart and sweep over me and submerge once
more my self-control. So I steeled my heart as best
I could.</p>

<p>She said no word of her meeting with the old
doctor, who had no doubt come down from London
to consult her, and had caught the last train back to
Victoria.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>Presently she asked—</p>

<p>“Can you get back tonight, Mr. Yelverton?”</p>

<p>“No,” I replied, “I sent my bag to the Sackville.
But now tell me, have you heard anything else regarding
Stanley?”</p>

<p>She gazed at me through the haze of her cigarette
smoke, and, after a pause, replied—</p>

<p>“No, I’ve heard nothing.”</p>

<p>“But, now, do be frank with me, Thelma. What
am I to think? This affair is growing serious, and I
know you are worried more even than I am.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Yelverton, I’m absolutely bewildered. All
I hear or find out only increases the mystery. But I
tell you quite plainly that I begin to think—more and
more—”</p>

<p>“What?” I asked, placing my hand upon her
shoulder.</p>

<p>“I—I really can hardly believe it—but from what
I have been told, I think Stanley is dead!”</p>

<p>“Who told you that?” I demanded, for it crossed
my mind that Feng had done no less—that that was
the reason for his visit. And yet as I watched her I
saw no signs of distress. Was she merely repeating
something she had been told to say. Did she, in
fact, hold the key to the mystery?</p>

<p>“What proof have you?” I asked quickly, as she
had not replied to my question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>“I have no proof, only what has been told me.”</p>

<p>“By whom?” I demanded.</p>

<p>“By a friend.”</p>

<p>“May I not know his name?”</p>

<p>She hesitated. Then she replied with narrowed
brows—</p>

<p>“No. I’m sorry, but I can’t tell you. I am under
a promise of secrecy.”</p>

<p>“You seem to have been under some such promise
all along,” I remarked rather petulantly I fear. Yet,
as Thelma stood there before me under the soft
shaded glow of the electric lamps she touched even a
softer nerve in me. Something that was all tenderness
and half regret smote me as I gazed upon her
lithe graceful figure like a garden lily standing alone
in the glow of a summer sunset. More and more I
realized my love for her and again, insistent and not
to be denied, the thought arose within me that if her
husband were indeed dead, I should be free to offer
her my hand! And the thought of what might be
merge into the wish that it should be? Was I, indeed,
a murderer at heart?</p>

<p>I hope that I am neither inhuman nor heartless.
Once, in my early youth I used to be quickly touched
by any kind of feeling; but before I met the pale
handsome girl who now stood before me, life had
seemed to me cold and profitless. Thelma Audley
was the one woman in all the world for me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>That is why I hesitated to press her more closely
concerning her informant. She was dry-eyed; could
she really believe that Stanley was dead?</p>

<p>I began to suspect that the clever old Doctor had,
all along, for some reason I could not even guess at,
misled me into a belief that he was antagonistic towards
her, while he was, in fact, secretly her friend.
She, who had fondly imagined that the riotous and
exuberant happiness that had commenced in Mürren
was permanent, had been sadly disillusioned by a
man’s love that had only blossomed like the almond
or the may.</p>

<p>She handed me her big silver box of cigarettes,
for she, like many modern girls, was an inveterate
smoker. I took one and she lit it for me with a gay
expression in her eyes which seemed to belie the
tragic news she had imparted to me.</p>

<p>That well-warmed room was indeed cozy and
comfortable, for outside it was a wild night in the
Channel. The heavy roar of the waves as they beat
upon the beach reached us, while through the window—for
the curtains had not been drawn—could
be seen the regular flashes of the Royal Sovereign
Lightship warning ships from the perilous rocks
off Beach Head, and here and there in the blackness
were tiny points of light showing that the fishing
fleet were out from Rye and Hastings. The very atmosphere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
seemed to be changed with the wild spin-drift
of the stormy sea.</p>

<p>I felt that though she was holding back certain
facts concerning her husband—dead or alive. Perhaps
she was doing so out of consideration to us
both. Try as I would, I could get no further information
from her. She would tell me no more
concerning her suspicion of Stanley’s death, and
later that night as I trudged along the storm-swept
promenade to the hotel close by, I confess that I felt
both baffled by Feng’s visit and annoyed at Thelma’s
dogged persistence in refusing to tell me anything.</p>

<p>Next afternoon, while I was sitting in my office in
Bedford Row, the telephone rang and a woman’s
voice asked whether I was Mr. Yelverton. I took it
to be a client and replied in the affirmative, whereupon
the speaker said:</p>

<p>“I’m Marigold Day. Can I come along and see
you, Mr. Yelverton?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” I said. “I’ll be in till five. Is it anything
important?”</p>

<p>“Yes. It is rather, I’ll come along in a taxi,” and
she rang off hurriedly.</p>

<p>About a quarter of an hour later my clerk showed
in the pretty mannequin from Carille’s, and when she
was seated and we were alone, she said—</p>

<p>“I—I want to tell you something about Mr. Audley.
They say the poor boy is dead!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>“Who says so?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Harold Ruthen. I met him in the Piccadilly
Grill Room last night with a girl friend of mine, and
he called me aside and told me.”</p>

<p>“What exactly did he tell you?” I asked eagerly.</p>

<p>“Well, he said that Audley had met with a motor
accident somewhere in Touraine, and had been taken
to the hospital at Saumur, where he had lingered
for four days, and died there. He asked me to keep
the matter a secret. Why—I don’t know. But if
the poor boy is dead I really can’t see any object in
keeping the matter a secret, do you?”</p>

<p>“No,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Well, I thought you, being his friend, would like
to know,” said the girl, sadly. She made a pathetic
figure, for she had been fond of Audley, and I knew
that under her merry careless Bohemian ways she
was capable of deep feeling.</p>

<p>I took her out to tea and questioned her further
about Ruthen, and the story he had told her.</p>

<p>She had no knowledge of old Mr. Humphreys, or
of Doctor Feng, but she was convinced by Ruthen’s
manner that what he had told her was the truth.
Besides, as the young fellow had been in such active
search for his friend there seemed no motive why he
should declare that he had died.</p>

<p>Was it from Harold Ruthen that Thelma had
gained the news? Or had Ruthen told old Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
Humphreys, who in turn, had told Feng, who had
gone to Bexhill and given her the report?</p>

<p>But was it really true?</p>

<p>I expressed my doubts.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Yelverton. I’ve only told you exactly
what Harold told me. He added the words: ‘After
all, poor Stanley’s death will prevent a good deal
leaking out. His lips are closed, and it means
security to several persons.’ I wonder what he
meant?”</p>

<p>“I wonder! He must have been in possession of
some secret which closely affected certain persons,”
I said. “And probably Ruthen is one of those who
now feel secure.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps. Who knows?” the girl remarked reflectively
as she crushed her cigarette-end into the
ash tray and rose to leave. “At any rate, I thought
you would like to know, as you seem so interested in
Stanley.”</p>

<p>I thanked her, and left her at the corner of
Chancery Lane in order to return to my office.</p>

<p>Saumur! I knew that it was an old-world town—the
center of a wine-growing country—somewhere
on the broad Loire.</p>

<p>I searched among my books, looked it up, and
found that it was two hundred and seventy miles
from Paris by the Orleans Railway, and that if I
traveled by the through express, I could go direct<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
by way of St. Pierre-des-Corps and Savonnières. I
resolved to make a swift journey out there and enquire
for myself.</p>

<p>Next morning I left London and in the afternoon
of the following day I entered a small hotel, the
Budan, at the end of the long stone bridge which
spans the Loire at Saumur. I lost no time in making
my inquiries in the old Huguenot town, famed for
its sparkling wines. At the Prefecture of Police I
saw the Prefect himself, a brisk little man with a
stubble of white hair, most courteous and attentive.</p>

<p>An automobile accident, and fatal? He would
have the records examined, if I would return next
morning.</p>

<p>I dined, spent the evening in the Café de la Paix
adjoining the Post Office, and next morning returned
to the Prefect.</p>

<p>Again he received me most courteously in his
barely furnished office, and when I was seated he
rang his bell, whereupon an inspector in plain clothes
entered with some papers in his hand.</p>

<p>“It is, I find, true, monsieur, that an Englishman
named Audley, christian name Stanley, native of
London, was motoring with two men named Armand
Raves and Henry Chest on the road between Langeais
and Cinq-Mars, when, in turning a sharp corner,
they ran into a wall, and the Englishman was
injured. He was brought to the St. Jean Hospital<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
here, put to bed unconscious and died four days
later. In his pocket was found a wallet containing a
number of notes of the Banque d’Angleterre of five
pounds and fifty pounds. They were sent by us to
the Banque de France to hold for any claim by relatives,
but curious enough, they were at once recognized
as forgeries!”</p>

<p>“Forgeries!” I gasped, pretending ignorance.</p>

<p>“Yes, Monsieur,” said the Prefect of Police, while
the Inspector spread out his papers on his Chief’s
desk.</p>

<p>“This telegram, Monsieur, is from the Bank of
England, in London, sent through Scotland Yard,
and says, ‘Numbers of notes reported in telegram
of 5th are part of South American forgeries.
Kindly send them to us for record.’ They have been
sent to London,” he added.</p>

<p>“But the men who were in the car with Mr. Audley.
Where are they?”</p>

<p>“Ah! Monsieur! We do not know,” replied the
shrewd old French official. “We only know the
names and addresses they gave to the agent of
police.”</p>

<p>“The addresses they gave proved false, Monsieur
le Prefect,” remarked the inspector. “But we photographed
them all—including the dead man,—and
we have a hue-and-cry out for them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>“You have a photograph of the dead man!” I
cried.</p>

<p>“Yes, Monsieur. It is on file among our photographs.”</p>

<p>“Cannot I see it?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Tomorrow, when we shall have further prints.
Ours have been sent on to Paris.”</p>

<p>“I would very much like to see it,” I said. “I am
a lawyer from London, and my inquiry concerns a
strange string of circumstances. This fact that
forged bank-notes were found upon the man who
died is truly amazing.”</p>

<p>“It may be amazing, but it is nevertheless a fact,”
declared the old official.</p>

<p>“But did the injured man make any statement before
he died?” I asked.</p>

<p>The inspector adjusted his pince-nez and searched
the <i>dossier</i>.</p>

<p>“I think he did,” he said. “Ah! yes! Here we
are,” and he took out a sheet of paper. “On the
morning before he died he spoke to Soeur Yvonne,
and uttered these words in English, ‘I am very
sorry for all I have done. I would never have done
the bad turns to Harry or to George unless it had
been to gain money. But I could not resist it. They
made me join in the scheme of printing false bank-notes,
though I warned them of the peril. I know I
must die, for the doctor told me so this morning.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
My only wish is that little Thelma may be made
happy. That is my only wish. Let her discover the
truth!’ Who ‘little Thelma’ may be, monsieur, we
have, of course, no means of knowing.”</p>

<p>“And was that the only statement made by Stanley
Audley immediately before he died,” I asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, monsieur. He died three hours later,” replied
the inspector.</p>

<p>“He said nothing else—nothing more concerning
Thelma?” I asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“Those words were the only ones he uttered,
monsieur,” replied the inspector. “It is fortunate
that Soeur Yvonne knows English, having been a
nursing sister in London. Of course, there is no
doubt that all three men were making a tour of
France distributing spurious English notes, for,
within a few days of the accident, many forged notes
were brought to the notice of the police in Nantes,
Orleans, Marseilles and Bordeaux. All of them had
been changed into French notes, and no doubt in that
car was a large sum of money.”</p>

<p>“Was nothing else of interest found in the dead
man’s possession?”</p>

<p>“Nothing except a card-case, a silver cigarette
case, a wallet containing 220 francs, the return half
of a first-class ticket from Brussels to Marseilles
and a tram-ticket taken in Barcelona.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>I left, promising to call again next day, and
wandered out upon the broad bridge that spans the
Loire and affords such a splendid view up the broad
valley. What could the dying man have meant by
that reference to Thelma?</p>

<p>I spent a very anxious day, trying to idle away the
time in the little museum in the Hotel de Ville and
inspecting the treasures of the ancient church of St.
Pierre. In the afternoon I watched the training of
a number of cavalry officers on the exercise ground,
and after dinner went to a cinema.</p>

<p>Next morning I returned eagerly to the Prefect
and the inspector appeared with several photographs.
One showed the wrecked car at the scene
of the accident and beside it stood two men.</p>

<p>“They are the men Raves and Chester,” remarked
the inspector.</p>

<p>“Who is the one leaning against the car. The one
with the cap in his hand?” I asked.</p>

<p>“That is the Englishman, Chester.”</p>

<p>And I had recognized him instantly as Harold
Ruthen!</p>

<p>“And the dead man?”</p>

<p>He showed me a picture of a man taken with his
head upon a pillow. But it was not that of Stanley
Audley, but of a round-faced man with a small
moustache—evidently the man who, when home in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
Half Moon Street had assumed the name of Audley,
while the real Audley lived as Mr. Graydon.</p>

<p>Sight of those photographs staggered me. What
message did the false Audley wish to convey to
Thelma? Was it concerning the whereabouts or
movements of her husband?</p>

<p>So Ruthen had been one of the rapidly moving
party which had gone to France in order to pass the
spurious notes, and with such disastrous results. It
was true that Stanley Audley had been killed, but he
was not the man of whom I was in such diligent
search, not the man to whom Thelma had been
married!</p>

<p>That afternoon I sent a telegram to Thelma at
Bexhill, assuring her that her husband was not dead,
and that same evening I left Saumur for London.</p>

<p>Next evening when I arrived at Russell Square, I
saw upon my table one of those now familiar envelopes.
It had been sent by express messenger
from Crouch Hill, and not from Hammersmith. On
tearing it open I read—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You are still beating the wind! As you will not heed
any warning and are still trying to meddle with affairs that
do not concern you, do not be surprised if you receive a
sudden shock. Your visit to Saumur was a perilous one for
more reasons than one. The truth is too deeply hidden for
you ever to discover it. Why court death as you are daily
doing?”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>So my enemies already knew of my rapid journey
to the Loire, though I had not told a soul, except
my partner Hensman! Evidently a close watch was
being kept upon my movements.</p>

<p>Ruthen was back in town, glad I suppose to escape
from a very embarrassing position, for it was clear
that both men had immediately made themselves
scarce, leaving their friend to his fate.</p>

<p>At the office next day I told Hensman of what I
had discovered, and showed him the note that I had
received on the previous night.</p>

<p>“Really, Rex, the puzzle seems to grow more and
more complicated every day, doesn’t it? The
change of names, from one man to the other seems
so very curious. And yet, of course, Audley must
have married in his own name.”</p>

<p>“But that remark about Little Thelma,” I said.
“The fellow just before he died expressed a hope
that she might be happy and that was his only wish.
‘Let her discover the truth,’ he said.”</p>

<p>“Which plainly shows that, whatever we may surmise,
Thelma does not know the truth,” my partner
remarked, leaning back in his writing chair.</p>

<p>With that I agreed. Yet our discovery threw no
light on the friendship between the two men who
had met at Mürren, the Doctor and old Humphreys;
their friendship with the foppish young fellow who
was a friend of Stanley’s and was now proved to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
one of a gang of forgers, and on Thelma’s secret
friendship with old Feng.</p>

<p>I rang up Bexhill half-an-hour later, and over the
’phone told Thelma that I had ascertained definitely
that the man fatally injured in the motor accident in
France was not her husband.</p>

<p>She drew a long sigh of relief.</p>

<p>“It is really awfully good of you, Mr. Yelverton,
to take such a keen interest in me and go to all that
trouble.”</p>

<p>“I know the truth as far as the report of Stanley’s
accident goes—not the whole truth, Mrs. Audley,” I
said. “I only wish I did. Won’t you give me the
key to the situation.”</p>

<p>I heard her laugh lightly, a strange hollow laugh
it was.</p>

<p>“Ah! I only wish—I only wish I dare,” she replied.
Then she added, “Good-bye. What you have
told me relieves my mind greatly and also places a
new complexion upon things. Good-bye, Mr. Yelverton—and
a thousand thanks. Mother is here and
sends her best wishes.”</p>

<p>I acknowledged them, and we were then cut off.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br>

<small>IN THE NIGHT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Autumn</span> was approaching. The long vacation
had begun, and London lay sweltering beneath a
heat-wave in the early days of August. Legal business
was nearly at a stand-still, and Hensman with
his wife had gone for three weeks to that charming
spot amid the Welsh mountains, the Oakwood Park
Hotel, near Conway in North Wales. Half the
clubs were enveloped in holland swathings for their
annual cleaning. Pall Mall and St. James’s Street
were deserted, for the world of the West End
seemed to be in flight, northward bound for the
“Twelfth,” or crossing to the French coast.</p>

<p>At the office I was simply “carrying on” with such
occasional matters as demanded immediate attention.
But legal business was almost dead, half the
staffs in London, our own included, were away. The
time hung heavily on the heads of those left in town.
I found life insupportably dull and had no energy,
when the day’s scant duties were over, to do more
than crawl back to my dull room in Russell Square
and sit sweltering in the torrid heat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>In accordance with the usual arrangement, I had
taken my holiday in the winter and was looking after
the office while Hensman was away. He was one of
the “sun-birds”; the delights of snow and frost had
no attraction for him, while to me the hot weather
was trying in the highest degree. Heat for him—cold
for me!</p>

<p>Bedford Row in August is indeed a sorry place.
The great wheels of the law machine almost cease
their slow remorseless grinding; lawyers and clients
seem able to forget their troubles and worries for a
brief spell. I lounged my days away, heartily wishing
myself elsewhere, but, with the help of the only
lady secretary left, perfunctorily getting through
such work as could not be shelved.</p>

<p>Late one afternoon, after an unusually busy day—for
I had instructed counsel to appear for a client
who was to be charged with a serious motoring offence
at Brighton—I had risen from my chair and
was about to take my hat and leave, when the telephone
rang.</p>

<p>On answering I found a trunk call had come
through from a village called Duddington, near
Stamford, in Lincolnshire. The speaker was a
young man who gave his name as Edward Pearson,
the son of one of our oldest clients, a large landowner
in the district.</p>

<p>Having told me his name he said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>“I wonder if you could come to Stamford tonight,
Mr. Yelverton? My father is ill and has expressed
his wish to add a codicil to the will you made for him
three years ago.”</p>

<p>“Is it a matter of urgency?” I asked. “My partner
is away, and it is a little difficult for me to leave
London.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I fear it is urgent,” replied my client’s
son. “My father had a stroke about three days ago
on his return from London. The Doctor declares it
to be a serious matter. Of course I won’t ask you to
come over to Duddington tonight, but you could get
to Stamford tonight, and sleep at the Cross Keys.
I’ll call for you in the car at nine tomorrow morning.
I’d be so grateful if you can do this. Will
you?”</p>

<p>I hesitated.</p>

<p>“You can catch a convenient train from King’s
Cross tonight. Change at Essendine. It takes
about three hours,” he added.</p>

<p>“Is your father in grave danger?” I asked.</p>

<p>“He was, but he seems a trifle better now. He is
asleep, and the Doctor says he is not to be awakened.
So we’ll see how he is in the morning.”</p>

<p>“Did he express a wish to make the codicil?” I
asked.</p>

<p>“Yes. He wants to leave the Gorselands to my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
brother Alfred, instead of to mother,” was the
reply.</p>

<p>“Very well,” I said, rather reluctantly, for as a
matter of fact I had been looking forward to dining
with old Mr. Humphreys that evening. “I’ll meet
you at the Cross Keys at Stamford in the morning.
Good-bye, Mr. Pearson.”</p>

<p>Having put down the receiver I resolved to ring
up Hartley Humphreys at the Carlton, and did so.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry you’re called away,” the old financier
replied. “But in any case come along now, and have
a cocktail. You won’t leave London till after
dinner.”</p>

<p>I took a taxi along to the hotel and found him
alone in his private sitting-room. Together we took
dry martinis, and while I smoked one of his exquisite
Turkish cigarettes I explained the reason for my
sudden visit to Lincolnshire.</p>

<p>“Well,” he laughed. “It all means costs to you, I
suppose. And after all I believe you have a dining
car to Peterborough, so the journey is not a very difficult
one.”</p>

<p>“No. But I wanted to keep my appointment with
you tonight,” I said.</p>

<p>The cheery old fellow laughed, saying:—</p>

<p>“My dear Yelverton, don’t think of that where
business is concerned. Come and dine another night—the
night after tomorrow. Feng is coming.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
We’ll have dinner at the Ritz for a change, and go
to a show afterwards. Any further news of your
little bride?”</p>

<p>“None,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Heard nothing?” he asked, looking at me curiously,
as though he held me in some suspicion I
thought. Did he know of my visit to Saumur and
my discovery concerning his factotum, Harold
Ruthen?</p>

<p>“Nothing,” was my reply. His attitude was
always curious whenever he made any reference to
Thelma.</p>

<p>In reply to a further question as to when I should
return, I told him that I must be back in London by
four o’clock on the morrow as I had an important
appointment regarding the transfer of some London
property—a side of the business which Hensman
usually looked after.</p>

<p>I smoked a second cigarette and rose. He
gripped my hand warmly before I left and repeated
his invitation.</p>

<p>“Feng is very fond of you,” he added, “and we’ll
have a real pleasant evening together.”</p>

<p>Back again at Russell Square I looked at the time-table,
dressed leisurely and packing a suitcase, took
the evening train from King’s Cross and having had
my dinner between London and Peterborough arrived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
at the ancient little town of Stamford in the
late evening.</p>

<p>It was, I found, a place of quaint crooked streets
and old churches, dim alleyways and a curious square
with an ancient Butter Market close by the old-world
hotel, the Cross Keys, once one of the famous
posting-houses on the Great North Road.</p>

<p>Beyond three or four motorists and commercial
travelers, I seemed to be about the only person in
the hotel, a roomy comfortable place with many
paneled rooms, and polished floors. About it was
that air of cozy comfort and cheery welcome such as
one finds to perfection in the too few old English
posting-inns. The coffee-room was bounded by huge
mahogany buffets laden with silver, and the drawing-room
was devoid of that gimcrack furniture which
one finds in most modern hotels.</p>

<p>My room, too, was big and spacious, with a window
looking out upon the great courtyard into which
the stage-coaches on their way from London to Edinburgh
used to lumber before the days of motors.
Yet even there I saw a row of stables and was informed
by the “boots” that in winter a good many
London gentlemen stabled their hunters there.</p>

<p>In the twilight, having nothing better to do, I
strolled out of the town along a path which led
through meadows beside the Welland river where
many people seemed to be enjoying the fresh air<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
after the unusual heat of the day, while many anglers
sat patiently upon the banks.</p>

<p>It was dark when I returned to the hotel, and
passing into the smoking-room I found several
men there, unmistakably commercial travelers. I
chatted with one of them, a tall, rugged-faced,
sharp-nose man in tweeds who spoke with a full
Yorkshire burr, and whose business was undoubtedly
“woolens.”</p>

<p>“I come here four times a year,” he told me.
“This hotel is one of the best in the Midlands. The
Bell at Barnby Moor is excellent, but a bit out of
the way for us. We have to stay in Doncaster.
Half our game is to know where to go, and how to
live. A commercial’s life is a pretty tough one now-a-days,
with high prices in traveling and cut prices
in the trade.”</p>

<p>He seemed a particularly affable person, though
his manner possessed that business-like briskness
which characterizes all men “on the road.” I set
him down as a man who could sell a tradesman
nearly anything, whether he desired it or not—one
of those particularly “smart” men found as
travelers in every trade, shrewd, clever and far-seeing,
yet suave ambassadors of commerce who are
invaluable to wholesalers and manufacturers.</p>

<p>“I’ve had bad luck here today,” he said. “I was
kept over-night in Peterborough and got here at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
eleven o’clock. Started out and forgot that it is
their early-closing day. So I’m compelled to be here
tomorrow instead of getting on to Bourne. One
can work this town well in a whole day—not less.”</p>

<p>I noticed that his face was scarred and furrowed.
He had no doubt led a hard life, and from his erect
bearing I thought that he might possibly have risen
to the rank of sergeant-major during the war. His
keen black eyes seemed to search everywhere, while
his nose was almost hawk-like. His cravat too, attracted
me. It was of soft black silk, neatly tied,
but in it was an onyx scarf-pin, oval and dark with a
thin white line around the edge. It reminded me
most forcibly of a miniature human eye.</p>

<p>As we sat together he gossiped about the bad state
of trade, the craze for cheap dress materials and the
consequent low prices.</p>

<p>“Things are horribly bad in Bradford,” he declared.
“Most of the mills are only working half-time.
In the cotton trade it is just the same. Oldham
has been very hard hit, now that the boom has
passed. Why, when that boom in cotton-mills was
at its height, men became semi-millionaires in a single
week. I know a man who was a clerk living in a
seven-room house and keeping no servants who
made a clear profit of a quarter of a million within
six weeks, and he made a further hundred thousand
in the same year. He’s just bought a pretty estate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
in Devonshire. And now the slump has come and
other people are bearing the burden which the lucky
ones unloaded on them.”</p>

<p>He took a cigarette case from his pocket and
offered me one. I took it and for a further quarter
of an hour we smoked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said. “This is a pretty comfortable
place. I’ve known it for twenty years—and it’s always
been the same. Old Brimelow, who used to be
the landlord, was a queer old fellow. He’s dead
now. He used to make us some wonderful rum-punch
in the commercial room at Christmas-time.
His father kept the place before him, and he could
remember the stage-coaches, the York coach, the
Lincoln coach, the Birmingham coach and the Edinburgh
coach, and tell tales of all of them.”</p>

<p>“Of highwaymen?” I asked laughing.</p>

<p>“No. Not exactly that,” he said merrily. “But
sometimes he told us tales of hold-ups that he had
heard from his father. Why, King George the
Third once got snowed up at the Colly Weston
cross-roads and slept there. Oh! this is a very historic
old place.”</p>

<p>After lighting another of his cigarettes I left my
entertaining companion and ascended the broad oak
staircase to my room, which was on the first floor.</p>

<p>It was a fine old apartment, three sides of which
were paneled in dark oak. The floor, on which a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
few rugs were strewn, was of polished oak and
creaked as I entered, while through the open window
the moon cast a long white beam.</p>

<p>After a glance out upon the silent courtyard I half
closed the window, drew down the blind and lit the
gas. Then, having turned the key in the door, I
undressed and retired.</p>

<p>At first I could not sleep because I heard the
scuttling of a mouse or rat behind the paneling. I
lay thinking of Thelma. A momentary wish, wicked
as a venomous snake, and swift as fire darted
through my thoughts. I wished that Stanley Audley
were dead. With such thoughts uppermost in my
mind I suddenly experienced a heavy drowsiness and
I must have at last dozed off.</p>

<p>I was awakened by feeling something cold upon
my mouth. I struggled, only to find that I was
breathless and helpless. I tried to cry out, but could
not. My breath came and went in short quick gasps.
Was it possible that I had left the gas turned on and
was being asphyxiated!</p>

<p>I struggled and fought for life, but the cold
Thing, whatever it was, pressed upon my mouth.</p>

<p>In the darkness I strove to shout for help, but no
sound escaped my lips, while my limbs were so
paralyzed that I could not raise my hands to my
face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>I recollect struggling frantically to free myself
from the horrible and mysterious influence that was
upon me. I tried frantically to extricate myself
from that deadly embrace, but was helpless as a
babe. I thought I heard the sound of heavy breathing,
but was not quite sure. Was I alone—or was
someone in the room?</p>

<p>My lips seemed to burn, my brain was on fire, a
wild madness seized me and then the cold Thing left
my lips.</p>

<p>I must have fainted, for all consciousness was suddenly
blotted out.</p>

<p>When I came to myself I heard strange faint
whisperings around me. Before my eyes was a
blood-red haze and I felt in my mouth and throat a
burning thirst.</p>

<p>I breathed heavily once or twice, I remember, and
then I lapsed again into unconsciousness. How long
I remained, I know not. I must have been inert and
helpless through many hours. Then I became half
conscious of some liquid being wafted into my face,
as though by a scent-spray, and once I seemed to
hear Thelma’s soft, sweet voice. But it was faint
and indistinct, sounding very far away.</p>

<p>I fell back into a dreamy stupor. Yet before my
eyes was always that scarf-pin like a tiny human eye
which had been worn by my commercial friend. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
had attracted me as we had gossiped, and as is so
often the case its impression had remained upon my
subconscious mind.</p>

<p>I lay wondering. Things assumed fantastic
shapes. I could still hear that scuttling of rats behind
the old paneling, and I recollected the narrow
streak of moonlight which fell across the room from
between the blind and the window-frame. I recollected
too, the sharp brisk voice of my commercial
friend, and moreover I once more saw, shining before
me, that tiny gem like a human eye.</p>

<p>After a lapse of quiet I tried again to rouse myself.
The room was still dark, and I listened again
for the scuttling of the rats behind the paneling, but
the only sounds I heard seemed to be faint whisperings.
Then suddenly I seemed to hear drowsy
sounds of bells, like the sweet beautiful carillon that
I had heard from the tower at Antwerp.</p>

<p>I lay there bewildered and alarmed. I thought of
Thelma—thoughts of her obsessed me. I did not
know whether to believe in her or not. Was I a
fool? In those dreamy moments I remembered my
last visit to Bexhill when I had questioned her. She
had trembled, I remember, and her lustrous eyes had
scanned me with what now seemed to my tortured
brain a remorseless and merciless scrutiny.</p>

<p>I recollected too, her words:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>“I am sorry, but I can’t tell you. I am under the
promise of secrecy.”</p>

<p>The whole enigma was beyond me: in my half
conscious state, the pall of a great darkness upon me,
I felt my sense strung to breaking point.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br>

<small>MORE DISCLOSURES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Ten</span> minutes later I grew conscious of unfamiliar
surroundings.</p>

<p>I was no longer in that dark old room at the Cross
Keys, but in a bright airy little room enameled in
white. I was lying upon a narrow iron bedstead and
my nostrils were full of the pungent odor of some
disinfectant—I think it was iodoform.</p>

<p>As I looked up I saw four faces peering anxiously
down into mine. The first was that of a grey-bearded
man in gold-rimmed spectacles, the second
was that of an elderly nurse in uniform, the third I
recognized as old Feng—and the fourth—I could
scarce believe my eyes—was Thelma herself!</p>

<p>“Thelma!” I cried eagerly, raising my hand towards
her.</p>

<p>“No! Keep quiet!” ordered the spectacled man
who seemed to be a doctor. “Listen! Can you
understand me. Do you hear what I say?” he asked
in a harsh voice.</p>

<p>“Yes, I—I do,” I faltered.</p>

<p>“Then keep quiet. Sleep, and don’t worry about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
anything—if you want to get well. You’re very ill—and
you’ve been very foolish. But if you obey
me you will soon be all right again.”</p>

<p>“But—but Thelma—Mrs. Audley,” I asked
eagerly.</p>

<p>“She’s here—by your side. Don’t worry, Mr.
Yelverton, go to sleep and you’ll be quite right again
soon—quite right!”</p>

<p>I looked at his great gold-rimmed spectacles.
They seemed to be magnified in my abnormal sight.</p>

<p>“But,” I asked boldly. “Who are you?”</p>

<p>“My name is Denbury—Doctor Denbury,” was
the old fellow’s reply.</p>

<p>“But why are you here with me in Cross Keys?”</p>

<p>“You’re not in the Cross Keys now. You are in
the Burghley Hospital. The police brought you
here, and sent for me.”</p>

<p>“The police!” I gasped, staring at those large
round spectacles, whilst next moment I shifted my
gaze upon Feng. “Look here Doctor Feng,” I said
addressing him. “What does all this mean?”</p>

<p>“Well, Yelverton, it is all a puzzle to us. Why
did you come here to Stamford and attempt to commit
suicide?”</p>

<p>“What?” I cried in fierce indignation despite my
weakness. “What are you saying? Suicide—why,
such a thing never entered my mind!”</p>

<p>Feng’s face wore a strange, cynical smile. Suddenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
I felt he was not my friend; for the moment I
hated him.</p>

<p>“Well, the facts are all too apparent,” he said
dubiously. “Whatever could have possessed you?
You’ve had a very near squeak of it, I can tell you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Yelverton,” said Thelma, bending over
me till I saw her dear face peering eagerly into mine.
“Yes. They thought you were dead. Why did you
do it? Why? Tell us.”</p>

<p>“Do it?” I gasped astounded. “I did nothing.
I—I only slept at the Cross Keys before going out
to Duddington to see a client.”</p>

<p>“But why did you come to Stamford,” asked the
girl, bending over me till I could feel her breath
upon my cheek.</p>

<p>“No! I forbid any further questions,” exclaimed
the bearded old doctor in the gold spectacles.
“Enough! He must rest, Mrs. Audley.”</p>

<p>Then I thought I caught sight of another man—a
policeman in uniform!</p>

<p>A few moments passed when suddenly the doctor
pressed a glass to my lips.</p>

<p>“Come. Take this,” he persuaded. “It will put
you to sleep again, and you’ll awake a new man.”</p>

<p>That strange cold pressure on my lips recalled
the Thing which had gripped me in the darkness,
and I shut my mouth resolutely. But he spoke so
kindly, declaring that it would do me good, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
inert and almost helpless as I was, I obeyed him.
The draught tasted of cloves, but was terribly bitter.</p>

<p>“Water!” I gasped, and immediately he held
some to my fevered lips. I took a great gulp with
avidity. Then I felt drowsy, and again lapsed into
unconsciousness.</p>

<p>When once more I opened my eyes my senses
seemed quite normal. I could see clearly, and I
could think and reason.</p>

<p>I found Thelma and old Feng again bending over
me, gazing very earnestly into my face.</p>

<p>“Where am I,” I asked eagerly. “What has
happened?”</p>

<p>“Surely you know what has happened,” replied
Thelma, “why did you attempt such a thing?”</p>

<p>“Attempt what?” I demanded.</p>

<p>“To take your life as we have already told you.
You took poison, and you’ve only been saved in the
very nick of time!”</p>

<p>“It’s a lie,” I declared angrily. “I never took
anything. What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Feng. “You were found in the
morning with your door locked, and as you didn’t
appear at noon they broke it open and you were
discovered insensible with the empty bottle beside
you and a note.”</p>

<p>“A note!” I cried utterly bewildered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>“Yes. You shall see it later on. It is addressed
to the Coroner, apologizing for your act!”</p>

<p>I held my breath.</p>

<p>“But, really,” I declared astounded, “you’re joking!
I never wrote a note, and I certainly did not
attempt to commit suicide!”</p>

<p>“Well, there are the facts,” said Thelma. “The
police brought you here and they found your name
on your cards, and in the letter you left. The affair
got into the papers, and I saw it. So I telegraphed
to Doctor Feng, and we both came here at once.”</p>

<p>“He must not be excited,” said the medical man
in glasses.</p>

<p>“Keep quiet, Yelverton,” urged Feng. “You shall
know all that has happened in due course. You owe
your life to Doctor Denbury’s efforts. He gave you
an antidote just in time!”</p>

<p>“But I did not write a letter, and I did not take
any poison,” I protested impatiently.</p>

<p>“Keep quiet,” old Feng urged. “It will all be
explained in due course.”</p>

<p>“It is so utterly mysterious!” I cried, half raising
myself.</p>

<p>“Yes, I agree,” said Feng. “The doctor has
found that you are also suffering from the after-effects
of some drug.”</p>

<p>“Does your head pain you very much now?” inquired
the doctor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>“Not so much,” was my reply. “But my throat is
very bad.”</p>

<p>“I expect so,” he said, and he crossed the room,
returning with a draught which, on being swallowed,
proved soothing. “Yes,” he went on, “you’ve had a
very narrow escape. I caught you just in time. I
presume that you must have swallowed the stuff
about three o’clock on the morning before last.
When I first saw you I gave you up as hopeless.
But by sheer luck I was able to diagnose what you
were suffering from. Funnily enough it was the drug
you took first that saved you. But,” he added coaxingly,
“go to sleep again, and when you wake up tell
us all about it. Your mind will then be quite clear.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Thelma, whose beautiful face peered
anxiously into my own. “Go to sleep now, Mr. Yelverton.
You must not exert yourself too much.”
And her soft cool hand smoothed my brow.</p>

<p>I remained silent and a few minutes later I had
again fallen asleep.</p>

<p>It was night when I found myself listening to an
astounding story. What Thelma told me was to the
effect that, on the door of my room being forced, it
was found that I had swallowed something from a
bottle which was lying on the floor, while on the
dressing-table lay a note addressed to the Coroner
and signed, “Rex Yelverton.”</p>

<p>Feng showed me the note. It was upon half a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
sheet of the hotel note-paper, but written in an unfamiliar
and rather uneducated hand.</p>

<p>“I never wrote that!” I protested, feeling now
quite better, after I had swallowed a glass of milk.
“And I certainly did not take any poison.”</p>

<p>“I knew it was not in your handwriting!” Feng
said, quietly. “As soon as Mrs. Audley telegraphed
to me I at once met her and we came on here together.
But, tell me, how did it come about that you
swallowed that stuff? It hasn’t been analyzed yet,
so Doctor Denbury is not quite certain what it is.
He, however, has made a guess, because of its smell.
But apparently you were drugged also. Tell me
exactly what you recollect about it. I want to know
everything, Yelverton.”</p>

<p>I tried to compose myself and reflect.</p>

<p>Presently, while he and Thelma sat side by side,
I told them pretty much as I have written here, exactly
what had happened since my arrival at the
Cross Keys.</p>

<p>Feng listened very attentively without uttering a
word. Now and then he grunted, but whether owing
to uncertainty or satisfaction I could gain no idea.
His attitude puzzled me sorely. I could not reconcile
his secret friendship with Thelma, with his pretended
hostility. Even now, in spite of the care he
was taking of me, I wondered whether he was my
friend, and in summing up all the past circumstances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
I came to the conclusion that he was not to be
trusted.</p>

<p>The effort of thinking out all this proved too much
for me, weakened as I was by the poison—whatever
it was—and, again feeling drowsy, I once more
closed my eyes, and slept.</p>

<p>I was conscious of a prick in my arm, and I know
now that Doctor Denbury gave me an injection.</p>

<p>Not until noon on the following day was I able to
get up and dress, and then, accompanied by Feng and
Thelma, I managed to walk round to the Cross Keys
which was only a short distance from the hospital.</p>

<p>The brisk, bald-headed manager invited me into
his private room and with many inquiries about my
health and expression of amazement, asked me to
relate what had actually happened. But what could
I tell him? I did not myself know.</p>

<p>Up till that morning I had—I now discovered—been
practically under arrest as having attempted
suicide, but now that it was clear that I had been a
victim of a plot, the red-faced constable whom I had
noticed idling about the room, had been withdrawn.
The papers had got hold of the story, and had made
a “mystery” out of it, to Hensman’s intense disgust.
On seeing the newspaper reports he had hurried
from North Wales to see me.</p>

<p>“You’ve been an infernal fool, Rex!” he said.
“I’ve telephoned to old Pearson at Duddington.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
He is quite well. His son never rang you up, and he
doesn’t want to add a codicil to his will. You’ve
been had—my dear fellow! You ought to have
heeded those warnings concerning that little married
lady!”</p>

<p>That was all the sympathy I got from him!</p>

<p>I told the bald-headed hotel-manager of my chat
with the rugged-faced commercial traveler from
Bradford, who was a constant guest at the hotel
and who had worn that curious onyx tie-pin like a
little human eye—that pin that I had seen in my
strange nightmare.</p>

<p>“Describe him again,” he said looking into my
face rather puzzled.</p>

<p>I did so, whereupon he replied:—</p>

<p>“I recollect seeing him at dinner. He was in
Number Thirty-Four, the room immediately above
yours. But he was a complete stranger. I’ve never
seen him here before. I don’t think he was a commercial.
At least he had no samples. The only
commercial travelers we had were Mr. Sharp from
London, Mr. Watson from Manchester and Mr.
Evans from Thomas’s, the flannel manufacturers of
Welshpool. I had a long chat with Mr. Evans in
the commercial room before we went to bed. He
remarked that there were only three travelers that
night—for it was unusual. We generally have eight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
or nine here, all of them known to us—except at the
week-end.”</p>

<p>“Then the man who told me about old Mr. Brimelow
was evidently not a commercial!” I remarked.</p>

<p>“Old Mr. Brimelow. Who is he?”</p>

<p>“The man from Bradford told me that he was
once proprietor here a few years ago.”</p>

<p>“Never,” laughed the manager. “This house has
belonged to the Yates family for the past seventy
years. The man evidently told you some fine fairy
stories.”</p>

<p>“Evidently he did,” interposed old Feng. “You
say that the man had a room over Mr. Yelverton’s.
That is interesting. May we see it?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” was the reply, and all of us ascended
to a small, stuffy little single room on the second
floor—the window of which was exactly over that
of the room I had occupied.</p>

<p>I told them of that cold thing that I had felt
pressed to my lips, but I could see that they were
all incredulous—the hotel-manager most of all.
Everybody who runs a hotel has a horror of any untoward
happenings there, for, of course, they are apt
seriously to prejudice business. In this case I was
supposed to have attempted suicide, leaving a letter
of apology to the Coroner. And I felt sure that
the hotel-manager believed that I had attempted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
my life, even though he seemed to humor me and
pretend to credit my story.</p>

<p>We had no police-officer with us. Feng had seen
to it that we had gone to the hotel unaccompanied.</p>

<p>The Doctor showed an inquisitive eagerness quite
unusual with him. He leaned out of the window in
order to ascertain whether he could see inside the
room below. Then from his pocket he took a piece
of string and lowered it to the upper sash of the
window of my room and made a knot in it. Afterwards
he examined the window-sill very minutely.</p>

<p>“Has this window been cleaned since?” he asked
the manager. “But there,” he added. “I see it
hasn’t by its condition. Not for a fortnight—I
should think—eh?”</p>

<p>“They were all cleaned about three weeks ago,”
replied the bald-headed man.</p>

<p>“Now we will go down to the room in which Mr.
Yelverton was found,” he said.</p>

<p>A few moments later we stood in the room
wherein I had been attacked. The manager pointed
out the table upon which the letter incriminating me
had been found, and I gazed wonderingly around.</p>

<p>“The bottle was found on the floor beside the
bed,” he said. “When I first saw you I believed you
were dead. Your mouth was discolored and your
face was as white as paper. Ada, the head chambermaid,
went into hysterics.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>“Yes. That’s all very well,” I answered. “But
what could have really happened? I only remember
that funny sensation of breathlessness and the cold
thing pressed to my lips—a bottle I suppose it must
have been.”</p>

<p>“Well, to me, it is plain that your entertaining
friend from Bradford was not exactly what he represented
himself to be,” said Feng, busying himself,
and examining the room with the closest attention to
every detail. Suddenly he seemed to bristle with
excitement, and turning to the manager he asked:—</p>

<p>“Did the man—what is his name—arrive here before
Mr. Yelverton?”</p>

<p>“No,” was his reply. “He arrived just after.
He gave his name as Harwood and particularly
asked for the room he occupied. He seemed to
know his way about the hotel quite well. He had no
luggage, except a small handbag, therefore he paid
for his room on arrival.”</p>

<p>“And when did he leave?”</p>

<p>“I cannot find out. The night-porter says that he
did not see him. He must have left very early, but
there is no train leaving here in the morning before
the 7.49.”</p>

<p>“So he got away by car, no doubt—a car that was
waiting for him somewhere,” Feng remarked quickly
with his gray brows knit. “Is his bag still here?”</p>

<p>“No. He took it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>“And none of the servants have ever seen him
before?”</p>

<p>“No. I asked the three commercial gentlemen
who were here that night, and they all declared him
to be a stranger. Commercial travelers always
know each other on the road.”</p>

<p>“Well,” I remarked. “It seems to me that my
entertaining friend must have known which room I
occupied, got down from his window to mine and
entered this room while I was asleep.”</p>

<p>“I think so, Yelverton,” said the old Doctor. “It
seems to me that entering by the window that you
left open, he first ascertained that the cigarettes he
gave you—which obviously were drugged—had sent
you to sleep. Then he pressed the little bottle to
your lips, forcing you to drink part of its contents—you
recollect the cold thing you felt upon your lips—and
then, not knowing how much you had swallowed,
because in the darkness he could not distinguish, he
threw down the bottle and leaving everything to
make it appear that you had committed suicide, he
clambered back to his own room and afterwards
escaped.”</p>

<p>“Do you think so?” asked Thelma.</p>

<p>“I do,” old Feng replied briskly. “Let us go upstairs
again and see what we can find.”</p>

<p>We did so. And on examining the outside woodwork
of the window which the affable man from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
Bradford had occupied, we found a large freshly
bored hole into which, no doubt, a stout hook had
been screwed. To this he must have attached a
rope, which enabled him easily to reach my window-sill.</p>

<p>Truly the plot of my enemies had been a well
thought out and ingenious one. The threat that if
I continued my search for Stanley Audley I should
pay for my disobedience with my life, had not been
made without the full intention to carry it out!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br>

<small>GROWING SUSPICIONS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I had</span> been fortunate enough in my life to escape
many of the shadows that lie in wait for most men.
No serious betrayal of friendship had come to make
me bitter or cynical: I did not—as even my profession
might have taught me to do—look upon men
with suspicion and distrust. I preferred to give
them my confidence.</p>

<p>But in spite of this I found myself growing more
and more distrustful of old Feng, more suspicious of
his motives, more convinced that, for some reason I
could not fathom, he was playing a double game.</p>

<p>I knew that he was on a footing with Thelma
quite different from what he allowed me to believe.
So much their secret interview at Bexhill had shown
me. And his attitude towards the attempt made
upon my life went to increase my distrust.</p>

<p>Had it not been that the handwriting of the note
left beside my bed differed so completely from my
own—why no attempt to imitate my hand had been
made completely puzzled me—I should undoubtedly
have been charged with attempted suicide. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
local police if not very brilliant, were keen enough
on the affair. I wanted to give them a detailed account
of everything that had led up to the attack on
me—to tell them the whole amazing story. To have
done this would have shown them that there was far
more behind the affair than they could possibly
imagine. They, of course, looked upon the matter
as being within a very narrow circle. I knew, as
Feng knew, that much more complicated issues were
involved.</p>

<p>Feng, however, strenuously opposed my proposal
to tell the police anything more than the barest facts,
which, indeed, could not be concealed. I wondered
why, and asked him.</p>

<p>“It will serve no good purpose,” he argued.
“These local policemen have already confessed their
ignorance of the man from Bradford. He was not
seen to leave by train, and as, from your description
of him his appearance was rather striking, I think,
we may assume he did not go that way. Probably
he had a car in readiness and escaped unnoticed. If
you tell the police more than they know already
you must inevitably drag Mrs. Audley and her husband’s
affairs into a very unpleasant publicity. No,
let us keep our own counsel.”</p>

<p>I remained in hospital two days longer. Thelma
and Feng visited me each day and I could not help
noticing the queer bond of understanding that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
seemed to have grown up between them. Not a
word was said by either of them to indicate that
they were more than mere friends but—perhaps
my growing suspicions were responsible—I seemed
to see or to imagine evidence that their association
implied very much more than I was intended to believe.
Feng had always opposed my association with
Thelma—had seemed, indeed, decidedly hostile to
her. His hostility, at least, had apparently evaporated.
Yet I found he was as strongly as ever
opposed to the continuance of my intimacy with her.</p>

<p>Did he fear for me? Did he fear for her? Did
he fear for both of us?</p>

<p>I could not tell. But there was no mistaking the
advice he gave.</p>

<p>“Look here, Yelverton,” he said to me a few
hours before I was to leave the hospital, “you have
had a very narrow escape. You owe your life to
the merest chance and you may not be so lucky in
the future.”</p>

<p>“In the future!” I echoed. “Surely you don’t
think there will be another attempt to get me out
of the way?”</p>

<p>“Indeed, I do,” he replied very gravely. “I don’t
pretend to understand the reason, but I should think
it must be perfectly clear that your friendship with
Mrs. Audley is involving someone in a danger so
grave that they will not stick at trifles to avert it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>“But how on earth can my friendship with Thelma
affect anyone else to such a degree as that?” I demanded,
with some heat. “Stanley Audley might
perhaps object, but even he could hardly imagine
that it was a cause for murder. And even if he did
the rather elaborate plot evolved by someone would
hardly have been the line he would have chosen.”</p>

<p>Feng shook his head. “You can rule Stanley
Audley, as the husband, out of your reckoning. But
what about Stanley Audley, the bank-note forger.
Suppose he and his associates know that your constant
efforts to find him might mean bringing the
whole gang to justice? Desperate men would not
hesitate at murder when the stakes involved are so
great. My own belief is they fear that by your
continued friendship with Mrs. Audley you will pick
up a hint that will set you—and the police—on the
right track. Probably they think that is your real
motive. Take my advice—I mean it very seriously—and
cut yourself adrift from the whole thing. Go
back to London, take up your work afresh—and
forget Thelma ever existed.”</p>

<p>“I can’t and I won’t,” I declared passionately.
“I’m going to try to get the man who attacked me,
and I’m going to try to find Stanley Audley. Thelma
thinks he is dead. I’m going to leave no stone unturned
to find out the truth. If he is really alive
and returns to her—well, I should have to keep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
away. In the meantime I want to discover the man
who tried to murder me.”</p>

<p>“He will be discovered some day, you can be
quite certain,” was Feng’s reply.</p>

<p>His tone surprised me completely: there was in
it a curious ring of certainty entirely unexpected.
It was as if he knew with certainty and positive
conviction.</p>

<p>I glanced at him sharply. “You seem very certain
of it,” I said.</p>

<p>“Well, I am pretty certain,” was his reply, with
a curious expression on his usually inscrutable face.
And once again came to my mind the uncanny conviction
that the old fellow really knew a great deal
more than he would tell me. My suspicions of him
redoubled.</p>

<p>“Drop it, my boy,” he said kindly enough. “If
you had taken my advice at first this would never
have happened.”</p>

<p>Then for the twentieth time he went over with
me every detail of the description of the mysterious
stranger from Bradford. What motive lay behind
the ceaseless questioning I could not imagine. Feng
was not a policeman, he strongly opposed telling the
police any more than we could help, yet he discussed
the man from Bradford as though he expected to
meet him in the street next day and arrest him on
the instant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>But for what I had seen myself, but for the unmistakable
“human eye” scarf-pin that I had unmistakably
seen when in the throes of what was so
nearly my death agony, I should have hesitated to
believe that the mysterious man from Bradford
could have been concerned in the attack on me. Anyone
less like a criminal it would be difficult to conceive.
His keen, cheery countenance, indelibly
stamped on my recollection; his frank, engaging
manner; his open, goodfellowship and gay-hearted
discussion of any and every subject of interest that
cropped up, all tended to give the lie to the suggestion
that he would be a murderer in intent if not
in fact. But that scarf-pin! It could not be mistaken.
There could not by any stretch of coincidence
be two such pins in that Stamford hotel on
the same night. And upon that pin I had undoubtedly
looked during that awful night when I so nearly
lost my life.</p>

<p>Another thought had flashed upon my mind.
Young Mr. Pearson had driven from Duddington
to see me. I had never spoken to him before and
instantly I knew that his was not the voice I had
heard upon the telephone. Then I knew whose voice
had come to me over the wire. It was that of the
man from Bradford. I wondered I had not thought
of it before. But I was sure my recollection was
right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>On that last afternoon, when the hospital doctor
pronounced me fit to travel back to London, I took
a walk with Thelma through the town, and out along
the pretty road which leads to Great Casterton. We
soon left the road by a footpath which took us up
the hillside and into some delightful woods, part
of the ancient far-reaching Rockingham Forest.
There we rested together on the trunk of a big fallen
elm.</p>

<p>Around us the sun’s rays slanting through the
foliage, fell upon the gray lichen of the huge forest
trees and the light green of the bracken, while the
damp sweet smell of the woods greeted our nostrils—that
delightful perfume which seems peculiar to
rural England in summer.</p>

<p>“Mr. Yelverton,” exclaimed my pretty companion,
gazing suddenly into my eyes. “I—I want
to ask you to forgive me. This wretched affair has
happened all through me. I alone am to blame
for it.”</p>

<p>“Blame!” I echoed, as I took her hand—“what
do you mean? You are certainly not to blame. It
seems I have a secret enemy who tried to kill me—I
don’t know why; I have done no one any harm
that I know of. But to say you are to blame is
absurd.”</p>

<p>“Doctor Feng says you should have taken heed
of the warning that was sent you concerning myself,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
she replied. “He thinks, too, that another
attempt will probably be made upon you—so do
be careful.”</p>

<p>“But why? Tell me why,” I demanded.</p>

<p>She spread out her hands in a little gesture of
helplessness and drew her cream-colored sports coat
more closely around her. She looked very sweet and
dainty in a close fitting little pull-on hat of cherry
color in fine pliable straw, a summer frock of pale
gray silk striped with cherry to match her hat, and
gray suede shoes and stockings.</p>

<p>It never struck me at the time that if she really
believed Stanley to be dead she would have worn
mourning.</p>

<p>“Doctor Feng is very concerned about you,” she
declared. “Has he told you anything?”</p>

<p>“No,” was my reply.</p>

<p>“Well, he seems very upset about something. I
can’t make it out.”</p>

<p>“Neither can I!” I replied. “The whole affair
of Stanley’s flight and the subsequent happenings
are beyond my comprehension, Thelma.”</p>

<p>“His flight!” she exclaimed in a startled voice.
“You surely don’t think that he has left me intentionally?”</p>

<p>“Then why doesn’t he write to you or return?”
I asked pointedly.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” she suggested gently, “there are circumstances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
that prevent him doing either.” I had
thought she would have been offended.</p>

<p>“No,” I said, “he is your husband. His duty is
clearly to tell you where he is and why he has not
returned. I am sure he would if he really loved
you,” I added recklessly.</p>

<p>She was plainly startled now. Whatever she
knew—and I was sure she knew more than she
would tell me—the idea that her husband did not
really care for her was clearly new and overwhelming.
She gazed at me white-faced and wide-eyed.</p>

<p>“If he really cares for me!” she whispered, her
eyes filling with tears.</p>

<p>I could not bear this. “Of course he cares for
you,” I said with a laugh meant to reassure her,
“but he ought to write to you anyhow. Perhaps he
has done so.”</p>

<p>I gazed at her as she sat at my side on that glorious
afternoon. Above us a pair of wood doves were
softly cooing, while a thrush annoyed at our presence,
uttered his clattering alarm-note to his mate.
Village chimes sounded somewhere across the Welland
valley, together with the shrill whistle of a
railway engine.</p>

<p>“Thelma,” I whispered at last. “Do tell me the
real and actual truth.” I looked into her grey eyes.
They were as unclouded, her cheeks as cool, her
candor and serenity as undisturbed as when, on that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
winter’s day amid the high-up snows she had shyly
thanked me for offering to look after her during
her husband’s absence. I, on the other hand, felt
like a fool. My heart, though I had done my best
to steel it to endurance, was torn by a thousand
conflicting feelings. Wild ideas rushed through my
brain. Was it possible that in her secret heart she
was not altogether sorry to be rid of Stanley
Audley? Had she married him hastily in an outburst
of girlish passion, only to find out her mistake
when desertion and solitude brought her opportunity
for reflection? Was this the real explanation of her
mysterious declaration that her husband would never
return to her? And if so was there still a chance
for me?</p>

<p>“Thelma,” I said softly, taking her hand in mine.
“I want to speak to you, but—but I hardly know
how to say it. Since you left Mürren you have
never been frank with me—never confided in me—never
told me the truth.” Then, after a pause I
went on. “Remember I took upon myself a sacred
trust, to see after you. I have carried out my promise
to Stanley as any honest man should carry it out,
but it seems that by doing so, I have brought a
deadly hatred upon myself. Why? I ask you,
Thelma—why?”</p>

<p>She drew a long breath, her hand trembled in mine
and her eyes grew troubled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>“Mr. Yelverton,” she said at last in a trembling
voice. “The question you ask me is very, very difficult
for me to answer. There are, I confess to you
at once, some things which I am bound for my husband’s
sake to conceal, and therefore I know you
will not ask me to divulge them. I can’t tell you
more. You nearly lost your life because of me. I
was to blame and I am very sorry.”</p>

<p>“But why?” I demanded. “Why ‘because of
you?’ How do you come into it? Neither of us
has done any harm.”</p>

<p>“I—I don’t know. Dr. Feng says you have
secret enemies and that it is because of me. That
is all I know.”</p>

<p>“But where is Stanley?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know; if I did he would be here. But
I believe he is dead.”</p>

<p>“But have you any fresh evidence?” I asked,
eagerly. “You know the man who was killed in
France was not Stanley.”</p>

<p>“I know only what I have been told.”</p>

<p>“But who told you?” I persisted.</p>

<p>“A friend. For certain reasons the strictest
secrecy has been imposed upon me. Please do not
question me further. You have been my dearest
and kindest friend and it is very hard to have to
prevaricate with you.”</p>

<p>“Thelma,” I said. “I have all along striven to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
be your friend, though circumstances have been
so much against me. I made a promise to Stanley,
and I have endeavored to keep it.”</p>

<p>“And at what a cost!” she exclaimed. “Yes! I
thank you awfully, for you have been the best and
dearest friend any girl has ever possessed. Yet you
have narrowly escaped losing your own life because
of your chivalry!” and her face flushed slightly.</p>

<p>For the second time my discretion went to the
winds.</p>

<p>“Thelma!” I cried, “don’t talk of chivalry. Can’t
you see the real reason? Can’t you realize that I
love you? Can’t you love me a little in return.”</p>

<p>Her cheeks grew hot. “I—I don’t know,” she
stammered. “It wouldn’t be right. I am married
already.”</p>

<p>The girl’s transparent innocence was amazing.
Not a shadow of a thought of wrong crossed her
mind. She gazed at me as candidly and sweetly as
if she had been my sister.</p>

<p>“But Thelma,” I pleaded, “suppose Stanley is
really dead; could you care for me a little?”</p>

<p>For a few seconds she sat silent, then she answered
in a low voice broken by emotion. “Before
I can answer that we must learn the truth.”</p>

<p>My heart gave a great leap. There was hope
for me.</p>

<p>“I will find out,” I declared, “whatever the cost.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>“But, Mr. Yelverton, please be careful,” she said.
“Dr. Feng is terribly apprehensive. He evidently
thinks you are in great danger and doesn’t want
me to see you.”</p>

<p>“But why should he be?” I asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I cannot make him out at all.
Sometimes I think he knows more than he will ever
admit about Stanley.”</p>

<p>But I cared nothing for Feng. My heart was
singing. Thelma’s words acted as a spur to my
decision to continue my investigations. I determined
once more and for all to play for the biggest stake.
If I lost I must accept my fate philosophically. If
I won—!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br>

<small>PLOT AND COUNTER-PLOT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Next</span> day, Feng having left for Edinburgh to
visit some friends, Thelma and I traveled to London
together. At King’s Cross I saw her into a
taxi, for she was going to Highgate to spend a few
days with a girl cousin, and myself went across to
Russell Square.</p>

<p>Mrs. Chapman was greatly excited at my return,
and was eager to know exactly what had happened,
for already Hensman had been round and told her
of my accident.</p>

<p>“Yesterday, about four o’clock, a gentleman
called, sir,” my old servant went on. “He was
very anxious to see you, and seemed worried that
you were away. I told him I expected you back
today. Then, after hesitating a little, he asked
leave to come in and write a note for you. He’s left
it on your table, sir.”</p>

<p>“Who was he?”</p>

<p>“I’ve never seen him before, sir. He was a tall
man with a long hooked nose, and a thin face deeply
lined.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>It sounded very like a description of my affable
friend from Bradford!</p>

<p>“Did you notice his tie-pin?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. It was a funny one—like a little eye.”</p>

<p>I dashed into my room where upon my blotting-pad
lay a letter. This I tore open and read. It
was written in the same handwriting as that mysterious
letter to the Coroner, and upon a sheet of my
own note-paper.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Do you refuse to be warned?</i>” it read. “<i>Drop your
search for Stanley Audley, or next time steps will be taken
to prevent you from escaping. It is known that you love
Thelma, and that is forbidden, for Stanley Audley still lives,
and is watching you!</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>There was no signature. I took from my pocket
the strange letter left in my bedroom and compared
them. The writing was exactly similar.</p>

<p>“How long was the man here?” I asked of Mrs.
Chapman, on entering the little kitchen of the flat.</p>

<p>“Oh! about ten minutes, sir. He seemed very
busy writing, so I left him.”</p>

<p>“Ten minutes!” I echoed. “Six lines of writing
could not take that time!”</p>

<p>Clearly there must be another reason why my
home should have been so boldly entered, so I
dashed back to my room and on opening the drawers
of my roll-top desk I found three of them in disorder,
as though they had been hurriedly searched.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>At once I realized what had gone. All the letters
I had received from Thelma I had kept tied up with
pink tape because of my legal training, I suppose.
They had been lying in the bottom drawer on the
right hand side. It was not my habit to lock up
anything from my old and trusted servant, hence
the desk had not been closed down. Had it been,
the drawers would have locked themselves automatically.</p>

<p>The letters were no longer there! The mysterious
visitor had evidently sought for and found them.
Was the intention to place them in the hands of the
missing man? Or was it blackmail?</p>

<p>Every incident in the queer tangle of events
seemed to add a further puzzle to the mystery of
Stanley Audley and his associates. An intention to
levy blackmail might explain the theft of the letter,
though they were innocent enough. But they did
not explain the attack on myself and the constant
espionage to which I was subjected. Why should I
be marked down for assassination? That I had
made a foolishly romantic promise to act as guardian
and protector of a pretty bride, was not enough to
answer that question.</p>

<p>Each day that passed since that fateful afternoon
amid the silent Alpine snows had increased the mystery
which surrounded Stanley Audley. Was he a
crook, an associate of an unscrupulous international<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
gang of forgers—or was he after all, an honest
man? If only Thelma would speak! But it was
obvious her lips were sealed, and I felt convinced
they were sealed by fear. Someone, it was obvious,
had some hold over her which enabled him to command
her silence. It was her duty as a wife, she
claimed, to preserve her husband’s secrets inviolable.
But what was the secret?</p>

<p>I returned to the office next day depressed and
puzzled to the last degree. I was hardly conscious
of what I was doing. As in a waking dream I lived
through the agony I had gone through at Stamford.
Time and again I seemed to feel that cold thing on
my lips; the small, evil-looking eye I had seen in my
half-consciousness seemed to glare balefully at me
even in the broad daylight. And time after time,
as I sat in my office striving wearily to read letters
and dictate coherent replies, Thelma’s exquisite face
appeared to float in the air before me. Distraught
and overwrought I realized at last that work was
hopeless and hurriedly left the office.</p>

<p>For hours I tramped the London pavements, tormented
by thoughts of Thelma, racking my brain
for some possible way out of the horrible position in
which I found myself. It must have been far into
the morning before—quite automatically—I staggered
homeward and flinging myself, dressed as I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
was, upon my bed, fell into the deep stupor of utter
exhaustion.</p>

<p>Four days after my return to London I happened
to be passing along Pall Mall, when a sudden fancy
took me to call upon old Humphreys. There another
surprise awaited me.</p>

<p>“Mr. Humphreys is away, sir—in Edinburgh,”
the fair-haired clerk at the key-office informed me.</p>

<p>Edinburgh! Old Feng had left me suddenly to
go there! Was it a coincidence, or were they meeting
in Scotland for some purpose?</p>

<p>“We expect him back tomorrow night,” the young
man added.</p>

<p>So I turned away.</p>

<p>Next day, knowing that Thelma was going shopping
with her cousin in the West End, I spent the
afternoon wandering in Regent Street in the hope
of meeting them. I had telephoned to Highgate
with the intention of making an appointment and
taking them to tea, but they had already left. Thelma’s
aunt, who spoke to me, had mentioned several
shops they intended visiting, and I had spent nearly
an hour and a half in search of them, when suddenly
near the Oxford Circus end of Regent Street, I
noticed a rather shabbily dressed old man standing
at a window, examining the jewelry displayed.</p>

<p>Next second my heart gave a bound. It was
Doctor Feng, but so well disguised was he that I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
was compelled to look twice in order to reassure
myself that I was not mistaken. Gone was the erect
alert figure I knew so well. The man before me
stooped heavily, with his chin kept well down; Doctor
Feng’s usually well-cut and well-tended clothing
had given place to garments utterly frayed and
shabby, while the old felt hat on his head was badly
stained and worn.</p>

<p>Instantly I drew back in astonishment, not wishing
to reveal myself. For what reason was he
idling there in that garb? He presented a broken-down
appearance, as if he were a professional man
who had fallen on evil times.</p>

<p>It was clear that his interest in the jewelry was
only feigned, and before long I saw he was keenly
watching the entrance to a well-known milliner’s,
though from such a position he was not likely to
attract the notice of anyone emerging.</p>

<p>I stood there watching the watcher, for perhaps
ten minutes. Then Thelma and her cousin came out
and turned towards Piccadilly Circus. Feng at once
moved slowly on, following their movements. I
was within a few yards of him, but so intent was
his watch upon the two girls that he never once
turned round. Otherwise he would almost certainly
have seen me, for I knew his eyesight was remarkably
good.</p>

<p>He watched them enter two shops, keeping himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
well away from observation. At last they entered
a tea-shop. Then having apparently satisfied
himself that they had seated themselves, he strolled
away.</p>

<p>In about a quarter of an hour he returned, and
so suddenly did he re-appear that I was half afraid
that he must have seen and recognized me. A few
minutes later, however, it became clear that he had
not, for again he stood idly looking into a neighboring
shop window.</p>

<p>When Thelma and her cousin came out they
crossed the road, and walked to Piccadilly Circus,
where they entered a well-known draper’s. It was
then after five o’clock.</p>

<p>Again old Feng lounged outside while I, fearing
recognition, remained on the opposite side of the
road near the entrance to the Café Monico.</p>

<p>The time passed slowly. The hurrying home-going
crowds focussed upon the Tube station where
all had become bustle, and already half-an-hour had
passed. I watched the old man peer into the big
shop every now and then curiously impatient and
anxious. It was plain that he could not see the
pair. He must have thought they were making extensive
purchases, for nearly three quarters of an
hour elapsed ere it seemed to dawn upon him that
there were two exits from the shop into Piccadilly!</p>

<p>His chagrin could be plainly seen. Ignorant, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
course, that they were being watched, the two girls
had unwittingly eluded his vigilance and calmly left
by the other entrance.</p>

<p>He hurried round the corner amid the crowd
awaiting the motor buses, and then sped back
again. It was plain that he was annoyed, and I
thought very considerably perturbed.</p>

<p>Realizing at last that they had eluded him he
crossed the Circus and entered a motor bus which
would take him home to Barnes. Then, having
watched his departure, I turned away and walked
thoughtfully back to Russell Square.</p>

<p>On leaving the office early next afternoon, I called
upon Hartley Humphreys, at the Carlton. A page
took me up in the lift and knocked at the door. But
before he did so I distinctly heard voices within and
recognized them as those of Humphreys and Feng.
They were laughing loudly together. When they
heard the page knock, they instantly ceased talking.
I heard a door communicating with the adjoining
room close, and then Humphreys gave permission
to enter.</p>

<p>The old financier sat alone and was most effusive
in his welcome.</p>

<p>“So glad to see you, Yelverton!” he cried, grasping
my hand. “Sit down,” and he touched the bell
for the waiter. “I’ve been north and only got back
last night. Next week I hope to move into that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
house at Hampstead that I’ve bought. I’m sick to
death of hotels. You must come and see me there;
come and dine one night.”</p>

<p>I thanked him and expressed great pleasure at his
invitation.</p>

<p>Why, I wondered, had Feng hurriedly disappeared?
He had passed into that adjoining room
which was a bedroom, and thence, I supposed, out
into the corridor. Or perhaps he was in the next
apartment listening to our conversation.</p>

<p>Over a whiskey and soda I told Humphreys of
the desperate attempt that had been made upon my
life, and described all the circumstances. Somehow
I felt confidence in him, even though he had Harold
Ruthen in his employ. I suspected Feng the more
because of the manner in which he had kept secret
watch upon Thelma.</p>

<p>“By jove!” said Humphreys, when I had finished.
“You certainly had a very narrow escape.”</p>

<p>“Yes. But fortunately the dose given was not
fatal, though the doctor has told me that had I
swallowed a few more drops I should certainly have
died.”</p>

<p>“But the letter to the Coroner!” remarked the
old man. “Your enemy took care to complete the
picture of suicide, didn’t he?”</p>

<p>“I should have had some difficulty in disproving
the charge of attempted suicide if it were not for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
handwriting,” I said. “The assassin did not reckon
on the chance that I should escape and prove the
letter to be a forgery!”</p>

<p>Then I told him of the visit paid to my rooms
and the theft of Thelma’s letters.</p>

<p>“Ah!” he said. “It is your association with that
little lady which has brought you into danger. Depend
upon it there is some secret connected with
Audley that, at all hazards, has to be kept—even
if it involves plotting your death. You have had a
pretty severe warning and if I were you I should
certainly heed it. Whatever the secret may be—and
it clearly must be something very serious—it
evidently does not concern you personally and if
you drop the whole affair you will be safe enough.
Surely there is no reason why you should run any
further risk?”</p>

<p>“It concerns Thelma,” I said doggedly, “and for
her sake I have determined, no matter at what risk
to myself, and no matter who threatens me, to elucidate
the mystery of Audley’s dual rôle, and his
curious disappearance. For the future at least I
shall be forearmed.”</p>

<p>The old man, with knit brows, shrugged his
shoulders dubiously.</p>

<p>“Of course I can quite understand, Yelverton,”
he said at last with a smile. “You have fallen in
love with her. Oh! it is all very foolish—very foolish,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
indeed. I suppose you have discovered a good
many things concerning Stanley Audley?”</p>

<p>“Yes, many curious facts which require explanation,”
I said.</p>

<p>“Really?” he asked, interested. “What are
they?”</p>

<p>In response, I told him one of two strange things
I had discovered concerning the missing man, at
which he expressed himself utterly astounded.</p>

<p>“I really don’t wonder that the remarkable affair
has bewildered you,” he said at last. “I had no idea
that Audley was such a man of mystery. I thought
he had merely left his bride and hidden himself because
he grew tired of her.”</p>

<p>“No. He is hiding because of his fear of somebody—that
is my opinion.”</p>

<p>“Have you any idea where he is?”</p>

<p>“Not in the least,” I replied frankly, at the same
time recollecting that his friend, Ruthen, whom I
so disliked, was also in search of Thelma’s husband.</p>

<p>“But don’t you think that his wife knows his
whereabouts?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I cannot form a decided opinion,” was my reply.
“Sometimes I think she does; then at others I feel
sure that she firmly believes that he is dead.”</p>

<p>“You do not believe they hold communication in
secret?”</p>

<p>“I think not.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>“What causes her to believe that he is dead, I
wonder?”</p>

<p>“Because she obtains no news from him and somebody
has told her so,” was my reply, reflecting that
Feng might be listening to our conversation.</p>

<p>Slowly he placed his cigarette-end in the ash tray
at his elbow and drained his glass.</p>

<p>“Well, Yelverton,” said the calm old cosmopolitan
who was once such a confirmed invalid and whose
lameness had happily been restored, “after all, I
don’t see how Audley’s movements concern you—except
for one thing—your indiscreet affection for
his wife. Of course the position does not please
you—it is natural that it should not please you—but
if I were you I would drop it all. I agree with
Feng that for you to continue can only lead to unhappiness.
More than that you run a great risk
at the hands of some unknown persons whose desperation
is already proved by what happened at
Stamford. Something more serious may yet happen.
Therefore,” he added, regarding me very seriously,
“were I in your place I would run no further risk.”</p>

<p>“I know your advice is well meant, Mr. Humphreys,”
I declared. “But I have made up my mind
to solve this mystery, and I will never rest until
I have done so.”</p>

<p>“For Thelma’s sake—eh?” he asked, or rather
snapped impatiently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>“Perhaps.”</p>

<p>“Then, of course, you must make up your mind
to take the consequences. You have asked my
advice, and I have given it. But if you pursue an
obstinate course,” he said, stroking his thin gray
beard as though in thought, “if you are so foolishly
obstinate you will have yourself alone to blame
should disaster fall upon you. I honestly believe
that if you continue, you are a doomed man!”</p>

<p>His tone of voice struck me as highly peculiar:
he might almost have been passing sentence of death
upon me!</p>

<p>I had no reason to doubt his friendliness, yet his
intimate acquaintance with Feng, whom I distrusted,
puzzled me more than ever.</p>

<p>“What causes you to think that another attempt
may be made upon me,” I asked again, looking very
straight at my companion.</p>

<p>“Has not the past proved the existence of some
mysterious plot against you—that some person or
persons are determined that you shall never learn
their secret?” he asked again very seriously. “Complaisance
is always the best policy before anything
we cannot alter.”</p>

<p>I saw the force of his argument, of course, but
with firmness replied—</p>

<p>“Nothing shall deter me from solving this mystery,
Mr. Humphreys. Nothing.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br>

<small>MISSING!</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A week</span> later I was engaged one morning dictating
letters to my typist when Hensman rushed
into my room, evidently in a state of great agitation.</p>

<p>“Can I speak to you for a moment?” he asked.
He was pale and agitated.</p>

<p>At a sign from me the girl left the room. “What’s
wrong, old man?” I said.</p>

<p>“Have you seen the paper this morning?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“No, not yet. Why?”</p>

<p>“Then you haven’t seen this,” he said, handing
me his copy of the <i>Times</i> which, as most solicitors
do, he was in the habit of scanning before he began
his day’s work.</p>

<p>What I read staggered me. It was as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Missing Lady</span></p>

<p>“The police are actively in search of Mrs. Thelma
Audley, aged 20, daughter of Mrs. Shaylor, widow of
Lieutenant-Commander Cyril Shaylor, R.N., who left her
home at Bexhill-on-Sea on the morning of the 18th inst.
after the receipt of an urgent telegram calling her to
London.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>“She did not show the message to anyone, but its receipt
apparently caused her great excitement, for she hurriedly
packed a bag, telling her mother that she would be staying
at the Grosvenor Hotel at Victoria and would return
next day.</p>

<p>“Nothing has since been seen or heard of her. She did
not arrive at the hotel, and it is an open question whether
she actually ever went to London.</p>

<p>“Inquiries show that she did not travel by the train she
intended. But as there are two lines of railway from Bexhill
to London the lady may have taken the second route, by a
train leaving half-an-hour later, which brought a good many
returning excursionists to London, so that she may easily
have passed unnoticed.</p>

<p>“One curious feature of the case is that Mrs. Audley, on
receipt of the telegram, apparently burned it by applying a
match, as the tinder was found in the fireplace of her bedroom.
Another most curious feature is that her mother
Mrs. Shaylor received on the following day a telegram handed
in at Waterloo Station, with the words, ‘<i>Am all right, do
not worry. Back soon—Thelma.</i>’</p>

<p>“Mrs. Audley and her mother are well-known in Bexhill,
where they have lived for two years. The young lady
married early in the New Year, but her husband being called
abroad, she has remained at home during the summer. Any
information concerning the missing lady will be gladly
received by her mother, and can be given to any police
station. Her description which was circulated yesterday is
as follows:—”</p>
</div>

<p>Then followed a very minute description of
Thelma, and of the clothes she wore when she left
Bexhill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>Thelma had disappeared! Did that mysterious
message emanate from her husband? Had she gone
to join him in hiding?</p>

<p>Why had she been so careful to destroy that message
which called her to London? If it were from
Stanley, as I felt certain it was, then what more
natural than that she would have told her mother
and explained that she was rejoining him?</p>

<p>She was elated at receipt of the message! Why?</p>

<p>“This is even more amazing than the past events,”
I declared to Hensman when, at last I found my
tongue. “What do you think of it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what to think of it, old chap,” was
my partner’s reply, “except that it makes the whole
affair more mysterious than ever. It is quite clear
she has disappeared of her own free will. Possibly
she has some motive, as her husband undoubtedly
had, for effacing himself, and I should think it quite
possible she has gone to join him, wherever he is.”</p>

<p>I put in a telephone call to Mrs. Shaylor at once.
Her strained voice clearly betrayed acute distress
and anxiety. When I told her I had read the account
of Thelma’s disappearance, she said:</p>

<p>“Oh! Mr. Yelverton, I am so terribly distressed.
What do you think of it all? I suppose you know
nothing of my girl’s whereabouts.”</p>

<p>“Absolutely nothing,” I said despairingly. “I
wrote to her some days ago, but had no reply.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>“Your letter is here. It came on the night she
left. I recognized your handwriting. I believe
she is in London, and that she sent me that reassuring
telegram from Waterloo, but the police do not
believe it. They doubt that she ever went to
London.”</p>

<p>“Who says so? The local police?”</p>

<p>“One of the two detectives who came down from
London yesterday to see me.”</p>

<p>“But that telegram which she burned,” I asked.
“Who was the sender. Have you any suspicion?”</p>

<p>“I feel quite certain that it was from Stanley.”</p>

<p>“Then if she is with her husband, why should we
worry?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Because—well, because I have a strange intuition
that there is something seriously wrong. Why, I
can’t tell—a mother’s intuition is usually right, Mr.
Yelverton.”</p>

<p>“Is that really all you know?” I asked eagerly.
“Cannot I be of any service in assisting to trace
her?”</p>

<p>“Well, the police are evidently doing their best,”
was her reply. “There is one queer circumstance
about the affair, namely that on the day before she
received the telegram, a stranger called to see her.
We had just had dinner when he was announced.
He was a tall, thin, fair-haired young man, and he
asked to see Thelma. She saw him in the morning-room,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span> 
and she was alone with him for about ten
minutes or so. After he left she seemed to be wonderfully
elated. She would tell me nothing, only
that some good news had been imparted to her by
the stranger. I asked her why she did not confide
in me, but she replied that it was her own affair,
and that at the moment she was not allowed to
divulge it. Later on she would tell me all. Then
next day she received the telegram which she had
apparently been expecting, and left.</p>

<p>“Oh! Mr. Yelverton! The mystery of it all is
driving me to distraction,” the poor lady went on.
“If you can do anything to help me I shall thank
you forever.”</p>

<p>“Listen, Mrs. Shaylor,” I said over the wire.
“Will you kindly repeat the description of that
stranger who called to see Thelma on the day previous.
It is important—very important!”</p>

<p>She gave a detailed description of the fair-haired
young man and the clothes he wore.</p>

<p>“Did she appear to know him?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! It was evident that they had met before,”
came the voice over the telephone. “He
greeted her merrily, and asked to be allowed to
speak with her in private. Later, I heard Thelma’s
voice raised in exultant laughter.”</p>

<p>“Have you never seen the young man before?” I
asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>“Never. He was a total stranger to me. But
Thelma knew him without a doubt. If you can
help me to re-discover her it is all I can ask of you,
Mr. Yelverton. You can imagine my distress. Why
she does not let me hear from her I cannot think.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps Stanley—who is evidently in hiding,
forbids it,” I said in an effort to relieve her anxiety,
though the fact of her disappearance in itself showed
some sinister influence at work.</p>

<p>“Perhaps so, Mr. Yelverton. Yet if that is the
case it is surely very unfair to me!”</p>

<p>“Time’s up,” chipped in the voice of the operator
at the exchange. “Sorry! Time’s up!”</p>

<p>And the next instant we were cut off.</p>

<p>Hensman had been standing beside me as I had
been speaking.</p>

<p>“Well, what shall you do now?” he asked.
“You’ve apparently placed yourself in a fine fix,
Rex. First you narrowly lose your life, and now
the lady is missing. Is it yet another plot?”</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly,” I replied, reflectively. “I must
have time to consider what steps to take.”</p>

<p>“If I were you I wouldn’t mix myself up in the
affair any further. Take my advice, old man. You
haven’t been the same for months. It has got on
your nerves,” he declared, as he filled his pipe.</p>

<p>“I know it has, my dear fellow, but when I decide
to do a thing, I do it. I mean to solve this enigma.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>“Well, you haven’t been very successful up to the
present, have you?” he remarked, a trifle sarcastically,
I thought.</p>

<p>“No. But I will not give up,” I said firmly. “This
second mystery of Thelma’s disappearance makes
me more than ever determined to continue my
search.”</p>

<p>“Then forgive me for saying so, Rex—it is perhaps
unpardonable of me to intrude in your private
affairs—but I think you are acting very foolishly.
If the young lady has disappeared, then, no doubt,
she has done so with some distinct motive.”</p>

<p>“In that case she would have confided in her
mother,” I argued.</p>

<p>“Over the telephone you spoke of some stranger
who had visited her.”</p>

<p>“Yes. It is that fact which urges me on to prosecute
my inquiries,” I replied. “The young man
evidently bore some message, but from whom?”</p>

<p>Hensman’s advice was, of course, sound enough,
but he was not in love as I was. He saw things
through quite a different pair of spectacles.</p>

<p>An hour later I took a taxi to Castlenau to seek
old Doctor Feng, my object being to ascertain
whether he had any knowledge of what had
occurred.</p>

<p>In answer to my ring the doctor’s housekeeper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
appeared. She was a sour-faced old woman in a
rather soiled apron, whom I had seen before.</p>

<p>“The doctor ’aint in, sir,” she replied, in true
Cockney intonation. “I don’t know where ’e is.”</p>

<p>“What time did he go out?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Oh! ’e went out on Tuesday morning, and ’e
’aint been back since. But ’e often goes away sudden
like.”</p>

<p>“Does he?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” I laughed. “I see you don’t like him.” I
hoped to get more out of her.</p>

<p>“I do. The doctor’s real good sort, sir. ’E’s
been awfully good to me and my girl, Emily. I
don’t know what we should ’ave done this winter
if we ’adn’t ’ad this place. ’E’s a bit lonely, is the
doctor. But ’e’s been a real good gentleman to me.”</p>

<p>“Do you happen to know a friend of his, a Mr.
Harold Ruthen,” I asked suddenly.</p>

<p>“Of course I know ’im, sir. ’E’s often ’ere. ’E’s
brought a lady once or twice—a pretty young married
lady. I don’t know ’er surname, but the doctor
calls ’er Thelma.”</p>

<p>Thelma! I held my breath. In face of what I
had learned this was staggering.</p>

<p>“I know the lady,” I said, with an inward struggle
to remain unexcited. And I went on to describe
her and her dress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>“That’s the lady, sir.”</p>

<p>“When was she last here?”</p>

<p>“Oh! Well, it was about three days ago, sir.
She came with another young gentleman whom
I’d never seen before—she called ’im Stanley.”</p>

<p>Stanley! Could Stanley Audley have been there?</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said excitedly as I stood within the hall,
“and what else? I have reason in asking this. A
great deal depends upon what you can tell me.”</p>

<p>“I ’ope I’m not telling anything wrong, sir,” replied
the woman. “Only you’ve asked me, and I’ve
told you the truth.”</p>

<p>“Thanks very much,” I replied. “This is all most
interesting. Describe what this friend of the young
lady’s was like.”</p>

<p>She reflected a moment, and then, telling me that
he wore a dark blue suit and was a “thorough gentleman”—presumably
because he had given her a
tip before his departure—she described a young man
which was most certainly the missing man, Stanley
Audley.</p>

<p>I questioned her, and she became quite frank—after
I had placed a couple of half-crowns into her
hand—concerning the visit of Thelma and Stanley.</p>

<p>“They came ’ere early in the afternoon,” she said.
“They’d a long talk with the doctor—a very serious
talk, for when I passed the door they were only a
talkin’ in whispers. I don’t like people what whisper,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
sir. If they can’t talk out loud there is somethin’
wrong—that’s what I always says.”</p>

<p>I agreed. Further, I gathered from her that the
conference between Thelma, Stanley and old Feng
had been most confidential.</p>

<p>“The young man left ’arf an ’our before the
young lady,” she told me. “’E seemed very
nervous, I thought. It was dark when ’e went, and
as he said good-bye to the doctor, I ’eard ’im say,
‘Remember, I’m dead—as before!’ I wonder what
’e meant? I’ve been thinking over it lots of times.
But, of course, sir, wot I’ve told you is all secret.
I ought not to ’ave told you anything. I’ve got a
good job, and I don’t want to lose it, as things are
’ard in these days, I tell you straight. So you won’t
repeat to the doctor what we’ve been talkin’ about,
will yer?”</p>

<p>“No!” I said. “Certainly not.”</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br>

<small>AT HEATHERMOOR GARDENS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> night the newspapers contained a paragraph
repeating what had appeared in the morning
concerning Mrs. Audley’s disappearance, and stating
that no trace of her had been discovered after she
had left Bexhill.</p>

<p>Her secret visit to old Feng, accompanied by
Stanley, three days before, added to the mystery.
Feng knew of my search for Audley. Then, why
had he not told me the truth? With what motive
was I being misled and befooled by a conspiracy of
silence?</p>

<p>I began to realize that that motive, whatever it
was, must be far stronger than I had previously suspected.
And in my heart, I confess, I was dismayed
by the knowledge that Stanley Audley was still alive:
it showed that the goal upon which I had set my
heart would never be reached. My distress and
dismay as I sat late into the night in my silent bachelor
room, may well be imagined.</p>

<p>Had Thelma purposely gone into hiding with
her husband, and with the connivance of Feng—or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
had she since met with foul play? Her failure to
take her mother into her confidence seemed to me
to suggest the latter.</p>

<p>I was strongly tempted to go to Scotland Yard
and tell the police all I knew about the missing girl.
But after long consideration I decided that I could
do little, if any, good. The police were pursuing
their own methods and what I could tell them would
not help matters much. In addition I am afraid
I did not want the police to get hold of Stanley
Audley. If, as I strongly suspected, he was engaged
in the nefarious trafficking in forged bank-notes, anything
I did could only bring fresh distress upon
Thelma. And I could not force myself to believe
that her husband would be sufficiently callous and
cold-blooded to allow any serious harm to befall
her. In the long run it proved I was right. The
issue was in other hands than those of Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>I was trying to fix my mind upon my work at the
office next day, when my telephone rang and I heard
the cheery voice of old Mr. Humphreys.</p>

<p>“Look here, Yelverton, I’ve been meaning to ring
you up for some days past. Can you come and dine
with me tonight? I’m in my place at Hampstead
at last—moved up here a week ago. Will you take
the address—14, Heathermoor Gardens—up at the
top end of Fitzjohn’s Avenue.”</p>

<p>I scribbled the address on my blotting-pad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>“You’ll easily find it,” he went on. “Come at
eight, won’t you? The best way is to go to Hampstead
Heath tube, and walk. It’s only two minutes.”</p>

<p>I gratefully accepted, for I wanted to discuss with
him Thelma’s mysterious disappearance.</p>

<p>“Have you seen Doctor Feng lately?” I asked
him, before he rang off.</p>

<p>“No; I think he must be in Paris. He told me he
was going over,” was the reply.</p>

<p>About a quarter to eight that night I emerged
from the lift at Hampstead station, and having inquired
for Heathermoor Gardens, walked through
the rain to a highly respectable road of large detached
houses, each wherein dwelt prosperous city
men, merchants, barristers and the like. The night
was dark, and even though the street lamps shone,
it was with some difficulty that I found Number
Fourteen.</p>

<p>The house proved to be a large corner one, of
two stories and double-fronted. Certainly it was
the largest and best of them all and had big bay
windows, and possessed an air of prosperity akin to
that of my friend, the Anglo-Turkish financier.</p>

<p>The door was opened by a round-faced clean-shaven
young man-servant who asked me into the
spacious lounge-hall in which a wood fire burned
brightly, and after taking my hat and coat, ushered
me into a small cozy library on the left, where old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
Mr. Humphreys rose from the fireside, greeting
me merrily.</p>

<p>“I’m awfully glad you could come, Yelverton,”
was his greeting, “I haven’t asked anybody to meet
you, for I thought we’d just have a quiet hour together,
so that I can show you round my new home,
and we can have a gossip. Sit down. Dinner will
be ready in a moment.”</p>

<p>Then he pressed the bell and a moment later the
man appeared bearing a tray with two cocktails. We
raised our glasses and drank. Mine was delicious.
I gazed around the sumptuously furnished room and
congratulated him upon it.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said. “I’ve tried to make it as cozy
as I can. I thought I would bring my furniture from
Constantinople, but on second thought, decided it
was too oriental and heavy and would hardly have
been in keeping with an English house. So I sold
it and have bought this place and furnished it.”</p>

<p>“It is really charming,” I said, noting the taste
displayed.</p>

<p>“Yes, I didn’t want it to appear too new, so some
of the stuff is second-hand. I hate a place which
looks like the palace of a war-profiteer, don’t you?”
he laughed.</p>

<p>The room was just my ideal of a man’s den, lined
as it was with books with a soft-lined Turkish carpet,
a big carved writing table and several deep saddle-bag<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span> 
chairs. The atmosphere was heavy with the
scent of his exquisite Turkish tobacco—that my host
smuggled—the only way to get the first grade of
tobacco-leaf.</p>

<p>He referred to it as he handed me a thin cigarette.</p>

<p>“In these days of Turkey’s trials—thanks to her
German betrayers, one no longer gets a little of the
tobacco reserved for the Yildiz as it used to be.
The Sultan grew his own tobacco in Anatolia—the
most delicious of all tobacco and the second grade
was sold to Europe as the finest. But the best was
always kept for the Yildiz and for His Majesty’s
ministers and his harem. I fear the few cigarettes
I have left are the last of the Imperial tobacco.”</p>

<p>My cosmopolitan host was a prominent and powerful
figure on the Bosphorus. I knew what he had
said was the truth, and I smoked the delicious cigarette
with intense enjoyment.</p>

<p>“Dinner, sir!” announced the smooth, round-faced
man.</p>

<p>Crossing the hall I found myself in a long, sumptuously
furnished dining room with shaded pink
lights and at a small table set in the big window
covers were laid for two.</p>

<p>A big dining table of polished rosewood, which
could seat a dozen persons or more, stood in the
middle of the room. In its centre was an oblong<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
piece of Chinese embroidery and upon it was set
a great apricot-colored bowl of autumn flowers.</p>

<p>“I eat at this little table,” he laughed as we sat
down. “One has to have a larger table, but I shall
only use it when I have guests.”</p>

<p>The room was a very handsome one with several
fine old portraits on the green-painted walls, while
a cozy wood fire burned upon huge old-fashioned
“dogs,” sending out a fragrant scent and a glowing
warmth which was comforting on that chilly autumn
night.</p>

<p>“It is most artistic,” I declared when I was seated.</p>

<p>“Yes, but somehow I miss the oriental sumptuousness
of my house at Therapia, down on the Bosphorus.
Still, when one is forced to live in London,
one must adopt London’s ways.”</p>

<p>The man had served us with excellent clear soup
and had left the room when my host suddenly looked
up at me and said:—</p>

<p>“Oh, by the way, what is the latest concerning
your little friend of Mürren and her husband?”</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Humphreys,” I said, “the fact is she’s
disappeared. That is what I want to consult you
about.”</p>

<p>“Disappeared!” he exclaimed, staring at me.
“Then she’s followed her husband into oblivion—eh?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>“It certainly appears so,” I said.</p>

<p>“Very curious! I didn’t see it in the paper,” he
declared. “Tell me what you know.”</p>

<p>“Well—what I know only puzzles me the more,”
was my reply. “She simply left her mother at Bexhill,
saying she was going to London, and disappeared.
But one very curious fact I’ve discovered
is that a few days ago she and her husband called
upon Doctor Feng.”</p>

<p>“Called on Feng!” he cried, starting up. “You—you’re
mistaken, surely! Audley has called on
Feng—impossible!”</p>

<p>“Why?” I asked, surprised to see how perturbed
he was. He saw my surprise and the next instant
concealed his keen anxiety. But it had struck me
as very unusual. I knew that Feng and he were
close friends. I suspected the former of knowing
more than he had revealed to me, and it seemed now
that old Mr. Humphreys was equally annoyed that
his friend had concealed Audley’s visit from him.</p>

<p>“It seems incredible that the missing husband
and his wife should call upon Feng,” he said. “How
do you know this, Yelverton? I am much interested—so
tell me. The whole affair has certainly been
amazing. You say they saw Feng a few days ago?”</p>

<p>“Yes, at his house at Castlenau,” I said. “But I
thought the Doctor would certainly tell you, as you
and he are such friends.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>“He’s told me nothing. I saw him only two days
ago and we spoke of you. He was going to Paris.
He declared the whole affair to be a romantic mystery—and
the unfortunate feature of it was—well,
that you had fallen in love with Audley’s wife.”</p>

<p>“I believed that Audley was dead,” I said, in
haste to excuse myself.</p>

<p>The old man stroked his scraggy beard with his
thin hand, and smiled.</p>

<p>“Ah! my dear Yelverton, you’re young yet,” he
said. “Nobody will blame you. She’s uncommonly
good-looking, and in her distress you, no doubt,
pitied her and then the usual thing happened. It
always does. She was alone and unprotected, and
you stood as her champion—eh?”</p>

<p>I only laughed. I suppose his words accurately
described the situation. But I could see that what
I had told him concerning this visit of the missing
man to Feng had somehow disturbed him deeply.
Indeed, his very countenance had changed. He was
no longer the well-preserved, hale and hearty old
man he usually looked. He had suddenly become
pale and wan, and he questioned me, with obvious
anxiety, as to how I had gained knowledge of what
I alleged.</p>

<p>Quite frankly I repeated almost word for word
what I have already told concerning my visit to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
Castlenau and what old Mrs. Martin, the Cockney
housekeeper, had revealed to me.</p>

<p>Humphreys only frowned, grunted in dissatisfaction
and remarked:</p>

<p>“I can’t think that Feng would have seen the
missing young fellow and say nothing to me.”</p>

<p>“Why?” I asked, perhaps unwisely.</p>

<p>“Why—well, that’s my own affair,” he snapped.
“I have reasons for saying so,” he almost snarled.</p>

<p>At that moment the man-servant came to take our
soup plates and served the fish with almost religious
ceremony—“sole Morny” it was.</p>

<p>Suddenly my host laughed, a deep, rippling laugh.</p>

<p>“Well, after all, Yelverton, you’ve been badly
bamboozled, haven’t you? You thought young
Audley was dead, and that dainty little woman was
free to marry you. But he’s evidently turned up
again. Yes—I realize the disappointing situation
from your point of view. Absolutely rotten!” and
he laughed merrily. He had apparently recovered
his usual self-possession.</p>

<p>But the change I had noted had set every nerve
in my body keenly on the alert. I remembered how
his face had changed, the sudden, sullen contraction
of his brows, his anxiety that was obvious no matter
how he tried to hide it. Of course I could not understand
his sudden mistrust of his friend, Feng.
Perhaps, after all, the old doctor had some hidden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
motive for concealing the fact that bride and bridegroom
had met again after those many months of
inexplicable separation, and that his silence was not
merely accidental. Still, it was clear Humphreys
did not think so.</p>

<p>“I thought that the doctor would certainly have
told you of Audley’s reappearance,” I remarked.
“Indeed, when you rang me up I was at once extremely
anxious to see you and hear your opinion
of the whole situation.”</p>

<p>“You want my opinion,” he said in a hard tone—a
voice quite changed. “Well, as you know, I
thought you a fool from the first. You ought never
to have had anything to do with the affair. It was
far too dangerous.”</p>

<p>“But why dangerous? Tell me.”</p>

<p>“Well—it was—that’s all. You told me of the
warning and of the attempt upon you. But tell me
more of Feng—of what his housekeeper told
you,” he urged, rising, taking a bottle of white wine
from the big carved side-board and pouring out a
glass for me and for himself. “This is very interesting.”</p>

<p>I described my telephone chat with Mrs. Shaylor
and my call at Castlenau in further detail.</p>

<p>“Strange!” he remarked, reflecting deeply.
“Really, I had no idea that Audley had ventured
to be seen again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>“Ventured!” I echoed. “Why did he disappear?”
His remark betrayed certain knowledge that he had
never divulged to me.</p>

<p>“My dear fellow,” he laughed. “He disappeared,
as you know, but I assure you I haven’t the slightest
knowledge of either his motive or his intention. I
believed Feng to be as much in the dark as I am.
But it is evident that he knows and has held back his
knowledge from me. I can’t understand it,” he
added, his countenance clouding again.</p>

<p>Then, after a moment’s reflection he said with a
smile:</p>

<p>“But, after all, why should I, or you worry, my
dear Yelverton? You have surely cut the little
woman out of your heart. If you haven’t—you’re
a fool.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t,” I replied frankly.</p>

<p>“You still love her?” he asked, looking keenly at
me as I sipped my wine.</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>“Then you are still a fool! I should have thought
that after all your experience of being misled, duped
and ridiculed, you would have seen how impossible
it was.”</p>

<p>“Why impossible?” I asked. “Mr. Humphreys,
I believe you know far more than ever you will reveal
to me,” I said earnestly. “Do tell me what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
you know. I don’t conceal the fact from you that
I love Thelma.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t. I’ve known that all along. So has
Feng. You’ve worn your heart on your sleeve for
everybody to see. Ah! how very foolish you have
been, my boy. But tell me—are you still determined
to solve the mystery concerning Audley’s disappearance?”
And again he looked straight into my eyes.</p>

<p>“I am,” I replied, “nothing will deter me from
seeking the truth.”</p>

<p>“Nothing?” he asked, with an inscrutable smile.</p>

<p>“No,” I said firmly. “I love Thelma and I mean
to clear this mystery up at all hazards.”</p>

<p>The man seated before me drew a long sigh,
and I saw that his brows were knit.</p>

<p>“Ah!” he exclaimed. “I repeat that you have been
foolish—very foolish, my dear young fellow, and
I am afraid that you will regret it when—when
too late.”</p>

<p>What I had told him regarding Audley’s meeting
with Feng had evidently caused him great anxiety,
and I noticed that he had left his wine untouched.</p>

<p>Again he spoke, but his words sounded so faint
that I did not catch them. At the same moment I
thought I heard in the distance a shrill scream—the
scream of a woman!</p>

<p>I listened. The scream was repeated!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>I saw Humphreys spring from his chair in sudden
alarm.</p>

<p>“Hark!” I cried, breathlessly. “What was that?”</p>

<p>But as I spoke the room seemed suddenly to revolve
about me rapidly. Then everything faded
from my sight: and I felt paralyzed.</p>

<p>Again that shrill scream of terror fell upon my
ears with increased distinctness.</p>

<p>Next second consciousness left me and everything
was abruptly blotted out.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br>

<small>THE CHILD’S AIR-BALL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> at last I regained consciousness, after an
interval I could not measure, my half-opened eyes
fell upon a strange scene, one which at first seemed
to be fantastic and unreal.</p>

<p>The room was unfamiliar, of good size and well-furnished
but dimly lit, only one light showing in the
electrolier in the centre. Even by that light I recognized
that it was neglected and evidently had been
long closed, for a strange close smell greeted my
nostrils and I saw that dust lay thickly upon the
round polished table in the centre.</p>

<p>Upon the table a small piece of candle was set
upon a plate.</p>

<p>I tried to make out where I was and what had
happened. But all I could tell was that I was seated
in a cramped position, tied hand and foot. My
limbs ached intolerably as though I had remained
there many hours.</p>

<p>Suddenly I heard a movement in the shadow, the
opening and closing of a door, and a moment later I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
saw silhouetted before me the figure of old
Humphreys.</p>

<p>“Well?” he asked in a hard, sarcastic voice, “and
how are you getting on now—eh?”</p>

<p>“I—I don’t know,” I replied so faintly that I
could scarcely hear my own voice. “Where am I?”</p>

<p>“You are in my hands at last, Rex Yelverton,” he
snarled. “You chose to interfere in matters that did
not concern you. You have had plenty of warning.
But as you refused to heed them I have decided to
act.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” I cried in dismay. “What
harm have I done you?”</p>

<p>The old man merely chuckled exultantly at the
way I had fallen into the trap he had so cunningly
prepared—with Feng’s aid, no doubt, I thought. I
had all along believed the old cosmopolitan financier
to be my friend. I sat aghast at the astounding discovery
that he was my enemy. For a few seconds I
remained speechless.</p>

<p>“Now,” he said in a deep vindictive voice, “there
is but little time left. Look over yonder.”</p>

<p>He turned the switch and the room was instantly
flooded with light, and as I gazed, dazzled by the
sudden brightness, I saw seated in a chair within a
few feet of me, a woman’s figure.</p>

<p>It was Thelma!</p>

<p>I shrieked her name, but only a faint sound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
escaped my lips, for my throat was dry and sore, and
I could scarcely raise my voice above a hoarse
whisper.</p>

<p>Her hair was dishevelled, her eyes were closed,
her face was white as marble, and her head hung
inertly on one side. She was clearly unconscious.</p>

<p>It must have been her scream of terror that I had
heard while we sat at dinner!</p>

<p>“What does this mean?” I demanded trying to
rise. But my hands were secured tightly behind my
back with a piece of rope, which had been passed
through a hole in the wall behind me and secured
upon the opposite side.</p>

<p>I was powerless to move more than six inches
from the wall!</p>

<p>“It means that you have only five minutes more
to live!” the old man answered slowly, with diabolical
grin. “You escaped once by a miracle—but
I have taken good care not to fail this time.”</p>

<p>“You assassin!” I cried, glaring at him and yet
entirely powerless.</p>

<p>“That’s enough!” he cried, striking me a blow
upon the cheek with his open hand.</p>

<p>“But I can’t understand!” I cried. “What harm
have I done—or what has Thelma done?”</p>

<p>“It does not matter to either of you,” he laughed.
“You love her. You’ve told me so. Well—in five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
minutes’ time you will be married to her—in
death!”</p>

<p>My brain was clearing rapidly as the effect of the
drug I had taken wore off and I was cool enough to
think keenly to desire some means of escape. But,
try as I would, I was powerless. The more I
strained at my bonds the more cruelly the rope cut
into my tortured wrists.</p>

<p>A flood of questions poured through my mind.
What could have happened? Where was Stanley
Audley? Was he in the hands of Feng, whom I now
looked upon as Humphreys’ fellow conspirator?
But, above all, what had I done—what had Thelma
done to arouse Humphrey’s diabolical hatred?</p>

<p>Despite the pain I was suffering I made another
furious effort to break loose. I strained, till I felt
my very wrists must give way, to go to Thelma’s
assistance. But I was held in a vise.</p>

<p>Thelma lay white as death. Was she, indeed,
dead already at the hands of the bearded fiend who,
I now thought, must be a lunatic.</p>

<p>My attention was diverted to Humphreys’ proceedings.
I watched him closely, puzzled by what
he was doing and utterly unable to comprehend his
purpose.</p>

<p>From a cupboard in the room he brought out a tin
of petrol. From his pocket he drew a large toy balloon
of the kind which enterprising firms use to advertise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
their goods. It was not inflated, but limp
and I remember that even in my bewilderment, I
noticed that it was a bright yellow and bore painted
upon it the name of a famous West End firm.</p>

<p>Using a small funnel he began very carefully to
fill the balloon with petrol. I was surprised at the
amount it held. The tin, which had been full, was
nearly empty before he had finished.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, like a flash of lightning, understanding
of his horrible purpose burst upon my mind.</p>

<p>“My God!” I gasped, “you surely do not intend
to burn us alive.”</p>

<p>“My dear young fellow, you have had every
chance to escape, and yet you have refused, because
of your silly love for Audley’s wife,” he said in hard,
metallic tones. “This house, I may tell you, is ‘to let
furnished.’ The board is now hidden in the shrubbery.
The dinner served you was provided by a
well-known firm of caterers who sent their man,
whom I have dismissed. In a few moments this
place will be a roaring furnace and a mystery-house
to the Fire Brigade of the London County Council.”</p>

<p>Then with diabolical coolness he went on with his
preparations.</p>

<p>Above the table was a handsome electrolier. To
this, by means of a piece of string, he hung the
petrol filled balloon so that it was suspended about a
foot above the candle I had noticed on the table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>“You see,” he explained with a grin, “I light the
candle and put it just below the balloon. You can
spend the time—it might be half-an-hour perhaps—in
imagining what is about to happen. The heat
from this little candle will cause the petrol slowly to
expand until it bursts the balloon. Then down
comes the petrol on the candle and the whole house
will be a roaring furnace in a couple of minutes. Do
you understand?” and he laughed in my face.</p>

<p>I ground my teeth, but made no reply.</p>

<p>“Well, good-bye, Yelverton,” he said in a voice of
affected cheeriness, and yet in triumph. “I wish you
both a merry journey into the next world. Perhaps
you’ll find her your soul-mate there. Who knows?”</p>

<p>Next instant he had switched off all the lights and
left us alone.</p>

<p>Only that fatal candle flickered as gradually its
heat was causing the fragile yellow balloon to expand
to bursting point.</p>

<p>Soon it would explode and then we should both be
burned alive. Nothing could possibly save us!</p>

<p>My heart sank. Once again, however, hope revived
within me. I strove to tear myself free from
my bonds. But it was useless.</p>

<p>I heard the front door close with a bang and then
knew that the man who had entrapped us had left.
No doubt he would be lurking in the vicinity in order
to make sure of the result of his devilish handiwork.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>I tried to rouse Thelma by calling to her. Apparently
Humphreys had not troubled to bind her
and if I could only awaken her she might be able to
get help before it was too late. But I could not raise
my voice above a hoarse whisper: no shrieks of mine
could call assistance. And, I reflected, Thelma, even
if she were not dead, must have been heavily drugged
and would no doubt remain unconscious for some
time. Humphreys would never have run the risk
of leaving her free to move if she came to herself.</p>

<p>My brain whirling I gave up the struggle after
one more ineffectual attempt to free myself and resigned
myself to my fate.</p>

<p>Horror froze the blood in my veins as I gazed in
agony first at Thelma, helpless and unconscious in
her loveliness, and then at that innocent-looking toy
balloon, charged with the deadliest menace, hanging
only a few inches above the flickering candle. To
my distorted imagination it appeared to be swelling
monstrously and hideously. I felt myself stupidly
wondering how much larger it would grow until it
split and let loose a flood of fire in that silent room.</p>

<p>I realized the devilish ingenuity of the scheme. It
was clear that once the balloon burst and the volatile
spirit became ignited, the furniture and hangings of
the room would burn with terrific violence. The fire
could not be seen through the shuttered windows
until practically the entire house was ablaze, even if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
at that late hour a chance passerby should come
along. And before help could possibly reach the
spot, the house would be a furnace. Every trace of
the cause of the fire would be consumed: only our
bodies, charred beyond all possible identification,
would be found beneath the ruins. Our fate would
remain unsolved and the fire would be relegated to
the ever-growing list of London’s unsolved mysteries.
I found myself dully speculating as to the insurance,
realizing that the owner of the house would
be duly recompensed, and that the assassin whom I
had never even suspected would go scot free.</p>

<p>And above all, even in those swiftly flying
moments, I still speculated as to Humphreys’ possible
motive in a plot which, I was now convinced,
must have been originally formed amid the snows of
Switzerland—a plot between the mysterious doctor
and the cosmopolitan financier who had posed as my
friend. How could Hartley Humphreys, reputed
millionaire, benefit by the extinction of two such
humble lives as Thelma’s and my own? Murder is
seldom or never motiveless, except it be committed
by the homicidal maniac. Was Humphreys really
insane or was he a cool, calculating, ruthless criminal,
working out to its logical end some plan to which I
had not the key?</p>

<p>At any rate, so far as we were concerned, we were
faced by instant peril. Humphreys had laid his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
plans well. We had no possible loophole for escape.
I was pinned and could not budge from the wall
against which I was held. If I had been handcuffed—and
handcuffs can be bought of many gun-makers
in London—they would have remained as tell-tale
evidence amid the débris of the fire. That length of
rope showed how cleverly the plot had been devised
so that all evidence of the murders would be effaced
by the roaring flames.</p>

<p>By the faint light of the candle I could scarcely
discern more than the marble face of the girl I had
grown to love. My eyes ever and anon wandered to
that yellow globe suspended above the table.</p>

<p>At any second it might burst. Then the flames
would run rioting through the room and in a moment
we should be enveloped.</p>

<p>Again I tried to shout for assistance.</p>

<p>All was silent. The candle flickered and then
again grew brighter.</p>

<p>“Thelma!” I shrieked in my agony, but my voice
was only a whisper.</p>

<p>“Thelma! Thelma! My God! <i>Thelma!</i>” I
cried, trying in vain to arouse her.</p>

<p>But she still remained there with her beautiful
head drooped in a manner which showed that either
death or unconsciousness had overtaken her.</p>

<p>I realized that death was very close to both of us.
For myself I cared little. I could face it. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
Thelma! Must I, loving her as I did, watch her die
before my eyes?</p>

<p>Those moments of agony seemed like hours.
Outside the circle of light thrown by the candle the
room seemed dark and cavernous. The smell of
motor-spirit hung heavily on the air and the silence
was absolute. I could even hear my watch ticking
in my pocket. Unless a miracle happened we
were doomed. I had become too weak to make
more than feeble efforts to free myself and these, of
course, were futile.</p>

<p>“How much longer?” I caught myself asking.
How long would it be before that innocent-looking
globe splits asunder and lets loose its flood of fire.
As the slow moments passed the pressure of the vapor
within caused the thin film of rubber which held
the inflammable spirit to swell larger and larger.</p>

<p>At first, I had noticed, it sagged heavily, dragged
down by the weight of the liquid. Now the bright
yellow globe was distended until it seemed on the
very point of bursting. The white printed words of
the advertisement on its sides danced mockingly before
my eyes.</p>

<p>Now and again the flame of the candle flickered,
caught by some stray breath of air. Then it steadied
and grew bright. I noticed that the wax had begun
to gutter into the plate. The evil flame fascinated
me: held my eyes fixed on it in helpless horror.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>By this time the balloon had become distended to
twice its original size.</p>

<p>Suddenly the end came. The balloon split apart.
A blaze of flame momentarily lit up the room and in
its lurid glow I caught a glimpse of Thelma. At the
same instant I heard a door open.</p>

<p>Then all was blackness and I knew no more.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI<br>

<small>WHO WAS DOCTOR FENG?</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I fancied</span> that I heard my name spoken. My
ears were strained—</p>

<p>“Rex! Rex! Listen; can’t you hear?” I seemed
to hear faintly afar off.</p>

<p>The voice sounded unusual, like a child’s, weak
and high-pitched. Surely I was in a dream.</p>

<p>“Rex! Rex! Listen! Can’t you hear?” the
voice continued. It seemed like the shrill voice of a
tiny girl.</p>

<p>I listened stupidly: in my lethargy I had not the
power to reply.</p>

<p>For a long time I listened, in a sort of delirium, I
suppose, but did not hear the voice repeated.</p>

<p>Suddenly, how long afterwards I cannot tell, I
distinctly saw Doctor Feng’s face grinning into mine.
Upon his white-bearded countenance was a look of
exultant triumph. His eyes danced with glee. The
sight angered and horrified me. I closed my eyes to
shut out the features that seemed to me sinister and
mysterious.</p>

<p>A strange sense of oppression, of being deprived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
of air and of my body being benumbed, overcame
me. I could not stir a muscle. In my ears there
sounded a strange singing like the song of a thousand
birds. At the same time I experienced considerable
difficulty in moving, for I seemed to be enveloped
in something which, weighing upon my
limbs, kept them powerless, as though I were still
manacled.</p>

<p>I remember that both my wrists pained me very
badly, where the rope had cut into them so cruelly.
Then, like a flash, came back a hideous memory of
those moments of horror and those darting red
tongues of flame. The terror of those moments
when I faced a horrible death I now lived over
again. I lay appalled.</p>

<p>I must have shrieked in my befogged agony, and
in shouting I again opened my eyes.</p>

<p>An eager face peered into mine; it was that of a
woman in a white linen head-dress—a hospital nurse
evidently. She uttered some words that I did not
comprehend. I tried to grasp them, but my hearing
was so dull that I only heard high-pitched sounds.</p>

<p>No wonder! After a few moments of blank bewilderment
I realized that from head to foot I was
swathed in oil-soaked cotton wool. There were
small openings for my eyes and another small aperture
lower which enabled me to breathe.</p>

<p>Now memory surged back upon me in full flood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
and again the horror of those dreadful moments at
Heathermoor Gardens fell upon me.</p>

<p>I recollected everything in detail. But I was alive—alive!
after passing through the valley of the
shadow of death, through the flames that had licked
my face!</p>

<p>But where was Thelma?</p>

<p>I tried to ask. But the calm-faced nurse only
shook her head. Was it that she could not understand
my muffled words; or was it that Thelma was
dead?</p>

<p>Once more I implored her to explain, but she
again shook her head, placing her fore-finger upon
her lips to enjoin silence.</p>

<p>Then she put some medicine to my lips, and speaking
soothingly, compelled me to swallow it.</p>

<p>I lay there stretched upon the bed, my wondering
eyes seeing only the whitewashed ceiling of the narrow
room. The atmosphere seemed heavily laden
with some disinfectant and I noticed, with idle curiosity,
how very closely the nurse watched over me.</p>

<p>I believed it to be about mid-day. But my bewildered
brain was obsessed by thoughts of those
two devilish plotters—Feng and Humphreys—who
had been my friends amid the Alpine snows and had
later conspired to kill me.</p>

<p>The full purport of what had actually happened I
could not understand: I remembered nothing after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
the flash of flame and the noise of the opening door.
Closing my eyes I racked my brain in useless conjecture.
Why should the hateful old doctor, of all
men, have shot that triumphant glance at me, while I
lay there inert and helpless?</p>

<p>After that I must have lapsed into unconsciousness.
The injuries I had suffered, coupled with the
awful mental agony I had undergone, had brought
about, as I learned afterwards, complete loss of
memory and many weeks elapsed before I was able
to understand what was going on around me.</p>

<p>My awakening to consciousness was a curious experience.</p>

<p>I was utterly unaware of anything that was passing
until suddenly, I heard, as from a vast distance,
a thin voice calling my name:—</p>

<p>“Rex! Rex! Rex Yelverton!” It came again.
Then I seemed suddenly to wake up. There was a
blaze of sunlight round me. And there before me,
radiant and beautiful in a flimsy white summer gown,
stood Thelma, her face positively shining with happiness
and tears of joy running down her beautiful
face.</p>

<p>I held my breath, scarcely believing I could be
awake. Was it a vision? Memory rushed back to
me. Again I saw Thelma, limp and helpless, in that
hateful room at Hampstead. Was I alive? Had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
she indeed escaped the awful fate that had threatened
her.</p>

<p>There she stood against a background of high
feathery palms. Beyond her was a sapphire, sunlit
sea, while around were orange trees heavily laden
with fruit and a wealth of climbing geraniums and
crimson rambler roses.</p>

<p>As my brain slowly cleared I looked around. To
my surprise I found myself seated in a low cane
lounge-chair upon a well-kept lawn—seemingly a
hotel-garden. Not far away some people were
strenuously playing tennis; others were seated beneath
great orange and emerald colored umbrellas,
taking tea.</p>

<p>“Thelma!” I gasped, my burning eyes staring and
bewildered.</p>

<p>“Rex! Thank God! At last! <i>At last you know
me!</i>” she said, springing forward and grasping both
my hands. “You’ve been very ill, my dear, devoted
friend.”</p>

<p>I stared at her and saw that she was very pale and
worn. But the soft hands that I held were real!</p>

<p>So surprised, so utterly perplexed was I, that I
could hardly find my tongue. But after a few moments
of silence, the chords of by unbalanced brain,
at first unable fully to realize my whereabouts, were
touched.</p>

<p>I heard her speak. “You <i>do</i> know me now, Rex—you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
do, don’t you?” she demanded in tense
eagerness.</p>

<p>“Yes,” I replied.</p>

<p>“And you can really recollect?” she asked, softly,
bending over me.</p>

<p>“Everything,” was my answer, as I sat there like
one dreaming. But, indeed, at that moment, I
doubted the reality of it all, for the evil faces of both
Feng and Humphreys overshadowed that fair scene
of feathery palms and tranquil sea.</p>

<p>“Ah! The doctors were right after all!” she
cried joyously. “They advised us to bring you here—to
Cannes.”</p>

<p>“What? Am I in Cannes?” I asked astounded.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, “This is The Beau Site Hotel.
Do you feel well enough to know what has
happened?”</p>

<p>I nodded—weakly, I am afraid. I felt well
enough physically, but shaken and overwrought.</p>

<p>“Can I have some tea?” I asked limply.</p>

<p>Thelma burst out laughing. “Now, I’m sure you
are better,” she bubbled. “Wait a moment and I
will have it sent out.”</p>

<p>She disappeared into the hotel and in a few
moments a waiter appeared with tea things. He
glanced at me and bowed. “I’m glad monsieur is
better,” he said simply.</p>

<p>How good that tea tasted! It was glorious to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
alive again and I ate and drank with good appetite.
I felt better every moment: it was clear I was well
on the way to recovery.</p>

<p>“And now, Thelma,” I asked when we had finished.
“Tell me what happened. I remember nothing
after the fire. Have I been ill long?”</p>

<p>“You must be prepared for a surprise, Rex,” she
said gently. “Do you know—of course you cannot—that
that was five months ago?”</p>

<p>“Five months!” I echoed stupidly. “Have I been
ill all that time?”</p>

<p>“You have been very ill indeed, Rex, and for a
time we had very little hope that you would ever recover.
You got over the burns fairly quickly in the
Hampstead Hospital but your memory gave way.
But don’t worry now, the doctors all said you would
probably recover yourself quite suddenly and be absolutely
yourself again. But they could not say how
long it would be and it has been weary waiting.”</p>

<p>“How long have I been here?” I asked.</p>

<p>“About a month. Doctor Feng will be here soon:
he will be delighted.”</p>

<p>“Doctor Feng!” I flared out. “Why should he be
pleased? Perhaps Humphreys will be pleased too.
He was a great friend of Feng’s.”</p>

<p>“Humphreys is dead,” Thelma said gently. “I
can’t tell you the full story yet—you are not well
enough—but he was traced from the house in Hampstead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
to some rooms he had in secret in Earl’s Court
Road and he shot himself there when the detectives
went to arrest him. Now be quiet and don’t bother
your head about things. Everything is all right and
you shall learn all from Doctor Feng. You can recognize
me now and you will soon be yourself.”</p>

<p>“But, Thelma,” I cried, “how did you escape?
Were you hurt?”</p>

<p>“Now, don’t trouble about me,” she said lightly.
“You will see Doctor Feng soon.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to see him,” I said snappishly. “He
was a friend of Humphreys’ and I believe was in
league with him.”</p>

<p>Thelma looked at me, a soft light in her eyes.
“No,” she said simply. “You are making a great
mistake. You never had a better friend, nor
Humphreys a more deadly enemy than Doctor
Feng.”</p>

<p>I sat up in amazement. Feng my friend! Had I
distrusted the old doctor without reason?</p>

<p>“Here he is!” cried Thelma joyously and I looked
up to see Doctor Feng, in a gray summer suit and
white felt hat striding briskly across the lawn towards
us.</p>

<p>A glance at me was sufficient to tell him the good
news; there was no need for Thelma’s excited outburst.
The old doctor silently held out his hand,
his seamed face alight with obvious pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>I took it in silence and wrung it hard. The scales
had fallen from my eyes and I felt thoroughly
ashamed of my lack of faith. I had ignored my real
friend and had put my trust in the scoundrel who had
planned, happily in vain, to send Thelma and myself
to a horrible death. At that moment my confidence
in my knowledge of men, on which I had been apt to
pride myself in bygone days, sank to zero.</p>

<p>Feng was the first to break the silence.</p>

<p>“By jove, Yelverton,” he said, “I’m glad to see
you all right again. You’ve had an infernally narrow
squeak of it. And it was all my fault. I ought
to have been more wary.”</p>

<p>“Your fault!” I stammered. “How?”</p>

<p>“Well, your narrow escape from being burned to
death with Thelma, was due in part to me. Owing
to my belief in my own foresight I made a big error
of judgment.”</p>

<p>“How? I don’t understand. All I know is that
Thelma and I were entrapped by your friend
Humphreys in that house in Heathermoor Gardens.
A most diabolical plot was laid for us both. What
happened?”</p>

<p>“Then you recollect it all—eh? Well, that’s an
excellent sign,” he said. “You both escaped death
by a hair’s breath. The damnable plot was well devised
and the plotters never dreamed for an instant
that it could fail. Every precaution had been taken,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
even to the cutting of the wires of the fire-alarm outside
Hampstead Station! Yes, you can both thank
Providence that you are alive today. But, do rest,
my dear fellow,” he added. “You must not tax your
brains too quickly. In an hour’s time I’ll tell you
more. Till then, I’ll leave you both together. But
remember, your conversation must not concern the
affair in the least. I forbid it, Thelma! Please
recollect that,” he added very seriously.</p>

<p>“Very well,” she said. “We’ll go for a stroll
down to the Casino and back,” and I rose and accompanied
her.</p>

<p>Thelma chatted as we strolled along. But in
obedience to Doctor Feng she would not refer to
what had passed. For my own part I felt utterly
mystified. Where was Stanley Audley? Why was
Feng my friend and Humphreys’ enemy? What
was Thelma doing here away from her husband?
How had we been saved? These and a hundred
other puzzling questions darted through my mind,
and I fear my attempts at conversation were poor
and spiritless.</p>

<p>But one thing she told me roused my keen
interest.</p>

<p>Day after day, she said, she had sat by my side,
many times every day, softly calling my name. Doctor
Feng was responsible. He had an idea—perhaps
because he knew my love for Thelma—that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
her voice might be the means of rousing me from
my stupor. And, thank God, the experiment had
succeeded, though Thelma confessed she had almost
given up hope after many weary weeks. At last,
after hundreds of failures, her call had reached my
subconscious mind, the dormant cells of memory had
suddenly awakened, my unbalanced mind once again
returned to its normal state.</p>

<p>As I looked into her great grey eyes, I saw how
filled she was with anxiety concerning me. I gazed
at her in silence. The suffering she had undergone
seemed to have had no power to mar her great personal
beauty. Though her face was colorless it was
calm, and her eyes were full of sadness.</p>

<p>One subject alone was uppermost in both our
hearts, but old Feng had forbidden us to mention it.
Therefore as we strolled along together through the
gay streets of Cannes with its well-dressed merry-making
throngs, our conversation was but a stilted
one.</p>

<p>To me that passing hour seemed a year. Soon I
was to learn the truth so long hidden—the secret of
the great mystery was to be solved, for I saw from
Doctor Feng’s manner that he knew the truth, and
would at last disclose it.</p>

<p>When at last the hour passed and we returned to
the Beau Site, Thelma took me up in the lift to a
comfortable private suite where, in the sitting-room,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
Feng was standing before the window which gave a
wide view of the Mediterranean, calm in the amber
glow of late afternoon.</p>

<p>“Let us sit down,” he said, and I noticed how
much more marked his slight American accent had
become. “What I have to tell you, Yelverton, will
take some little time. It will surprise you too, for it
is a remarkable and complicated story—an amazing
hotchpotch of love, hate, avarice, and a callous,
cruel cunning perfectly devilish. I may as well begin
at the beginning.”</p>

<p>I took an easy chair and the old man went on with
his strange history.</p>

<p>“First of all,” he said, “it is necessary to go back
to the days when Thelma’s father was alive and on
the China station. You will remember I told you he
was able to render a very great service to Sung-tchun,
who was one of the leaders of the Thu-tseng.
Exactly what that service was we shall never know—the
secret would involve too many men who are
still alive.</p>

<p>“But whatever it was, it was very important—very
much more than a mere matter of organizing
the escape of Sung-tchun from Siberia. That, of
course, was important, but, after all, it was only a
matter of one man’s life. There must have been
something far greater, of which we shall probably
never learn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>“Do you remember my once saying to you that the
arm of the Thu-tseng was long?”</p>

<p>I nodded. I remembered perfectly the old chap’s
grave look as he spoke the words. I had little suspected
their tremendous import.</p>

<p>“Well,” Feng continued, “you and Thelma have
to thank the Crystal Claw for the fact that you are
alive today. Had I not been at Mürren when it
arrived, had I not know its significance, the devilish
plot planned by Humphreys must have succeeded.</p>

<p>“I did not know when I arrived at Mürren any of
the facts that soon after came into my possession.
That I should have been there was one of the wonderful
instances of the working of Providence.</p>

<p>“The arrival of the Crystal Claw fairly staggered
me. Never before has it been bestowed upon a
European. I knew at once that around Mrs. Audley
some tremendous story must hang. I am not unknown
in the Thu-tseng and I determined to get at
the truth. What I learned in reply to my cables both
surprised and alarmed me. It showed me that Mrs.
Audley was in terrible danger. It put me at once on
my guard with reference to Hartley Humphreys.
From that time forward he was under almost incessant
supervision.</p>

<p>“Now here are the essential facts. Sung-tchun
was an extremely wealthy man—how wealthy no one
exactly knew. He made a very remarkable will, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
which he left the whole of his vast fortune to Miss
Thelma Shaylor.”</p>

<p>Thelma started violently. “Left a fortune to
me!” she burst out. “Why I never heard a word
about it.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Feng, “there was a proviso in the will
that except for some grave reason, of which the
trustees were to be the judges, you were not to be
told until you reached the age of twenty-one. Sung-tchun
was anxious that you should not be exposed to
the advances of mere fortune-hunters until you were
old enough to have had a reasonable experience of
the world.</p>

<p>“Now if the will had contained nothing else there
would have been no difficulty: you would have been
perfectly safe. Unfortunately Sung-tchun added a
codicil which was, as events proved, to bring you into
terrible peril.</p>

<p>“That codicil provided that if you died childless
the vast bulk of Sung-tchun’s wealth should devolve
upon a Chinese named Chi-ho who was living in
New York. Now here is a crucial fact. Chi-ho was
hopelessly in the power of Hartley Humphreys.</p>

<p>“Humphreys learned of the provisions of Sung-tchun’s
will. He had lived in China; he knew the
country well and he was very wealthy. By the
treachery of an official of the Thu-tseng he learned
of that fatal codicil. It was an amazing instance of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
leakage of information for which the history of the
Thu-tseng knows no parallel and the offender has expiated
his crime by the forfeit of his life.</p>

<p>“Chi-ho probably never realized the vastness of
the sum to which he would be entitled if Thelma
died childless. Humphreys, no doubt, only told him
part of the truth. Chi-ho, in consideration of getting
his freedom from Humphreys made over to the
latter, in strictly legal form, all his interests under
the will of Sung-tchun. That document was found
among Humphreys’ papers after his death, of which
Thelma has already told you.</p>

<p>“Very soon after that document was signed Chi-ho
died—stabbed to death in what was said to be a tong
feud in the Chinatown district of New York. I cannot
say with certainty that the whole thing was arranged
by Hartley Humphreys but Chi-ho’s death
was very convenient to him.</p>

<p>“Now you have this interesting position: only
Thelma’s life stood between Hartley Humphreys
and the Sung-tchun fortune.</p>

<p>“All these facts came to me by cable—in code, of
course, from Canton. I did not think it necessary or
desirable to tell you and of course I had no permission
to reveal the fact that Thelma was a great
heiress. But I was keenly on the watch. My Canton
correspondent warned me very specifically to
beware of Hartley Humphreys, whose secret record<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
in China—outwardly he was of the highest respectability—was
appalling. And the Thu-tseng knew all
there was to know about him.</p>

<p>“That will explain to you, Yelverton, Humphreys’
alarm when he saw the Crystal Claw. He knew it
might mean anything—for instance that Thelma
was being watched over and guarded by the agents
of the most powerful secret society in the world. If
that were the case, he knew, a single false step would
mean his certain ruin—perhaps even his death.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t seem much concerned about his alarm
when I told you,” I interrupted.</p>

<p>“No,” said the doctor with a smile, “it wasn’t
necessary. I should not have been surprised if the
sight of the Crystal Claw had frightened him off his
scheme. But his avarice was evidently so unbounded
that he was willing to run any risk for the sake of
money.</p>

<p>“Now comes a curious part of the story that I
think Mrs. Audley had better tell herself.” He
turned to Thelma. “Please tell Mr. Yelverton
about your marriage,” he said.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Thelma, hesitatingly. “I was introduced
to Stanley Audley at a dance at Harrogate.
He was an electrical engineer and was apparently
also possessed of considerable means. We met frequently.
Twice I had tea at his rooms in London
and one day at the Savoy he introduced me to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
Harold Ruthen who, I understood, was a newly
formed acquaintance of his.</p>

<p>“Mother rather liked Stanley, who always spoke
enthusiastically of his firm, Messrs. Gordon &amp; Austin,
the great electrical supply company, and of his
eagerness for advancement. When we became
engaged mother raised no objection, for he was so
keen and enthusiastic in everything. One day he
motored me down to a place called ‘Crowmarsh,’
near Wallingford, where I found he possessed a fine
old-world house, where we were to live when we
married. I was charmed with it and we both spent
a glorious day there. Three weeks later we were,
as you know, quietly married at St. James’ church
in Piccadilly, and went at once out to Switzerland
for our honeymoon, where we met you both.</p>

<p>“Then one morning Stanley received a telegram.
When he read it he became both confused and
alarmed. He did not show me the message, but told
me that it was imperative that he should return to
London at once. I now recollect that we were in the
hall of the Kürhaus when the concierge handed him
the message, and seated in his invalid chair, near the
big stove on the right, was old Mr. Humphreys,
whom I did not then know, but who was no doubt
watching us intently.”</p>

<p>“He had followed you to Mürren with a very
definite object,” Feng went on. “He must have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
watching you for some months beforehand, and I
have no doubt your sudden marriage was a severe
blow to his plans.</p>

<p>“I had serious difficulty in making friends with
him. Of course he knew I was a Chinese and I
really believe that he suspected at first that I was an
agent of the Thu-tseng. It was only when he found
that I had been at Mürren some time before Thelma
and Audley arrived—and therefore, he thought,
could not be specially interested in them—that I succeeded
in getting inside his guard. Of course, by
posing as his friend, I was able much more easily to
keep track of his movements.</p>

<p>“Do you remember your escape from the
avalanche?”</p>

<p>“Rather!” said Thelma and I simultaneously.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you will be surprised to learn that that
avalanche was not the unaided work of Nature,”
said the doctor. “You did not notice a man some
hundreds of feet above you?”</p>

<p>“No,” I said, “but what do you mean?”</p>

<p>“It’s a very easy thing to start an avalanche,” said
Feng with a smile. “There <i>was</i> a man above you
that day and the avalanche <i>was</i> started deliberately.
Your guide John found out the truth afterwards.
But the would-be assassin—I have no doubt he was
in the pay of Humphreys—was never traced and the
matter was hushed up. It would not have done to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
let Humphreys know that the truth was suspected.
As a matter of fact I did suspect it and implored
John to investigate.</p>

<p>“But with regard to Stanley Audley I confess I
was completely misled. When he received that telegram
recalling him to London I believed that the
story he had told you about his profession as electrical
engineer, was a true one. Only when it was
proved to be without foundation did I see that I,
like yourself, had been cleverly bamboozled. Until
then I had believed Audley to be what he represented
himself to be. I never dreamed of the truth.
Hartley Humphreys, a crook to his finger tips, possessed
a master-mind, obsessed by criminality, and
having no idea of my actual purpose he acted with
such amazing cunning and forethought that he must
be placed among the list of the master-criminals of
the world.”</p>

<p>“Of course I had no suspicion,” said Thelma. “I
didn’t even know that I was an heiress.”</p>

<p>“And I was fool enough to think that Humphreys
was my friend and you were my enemy, Doctor,” I
said with some shame as I thought of how completely
I had been deceived.</p>

<p>“Well,” laughed Feng, “that’s all over now. But
I’m glad I was able to deceive you because it helped
me to deceive Humphreys. He was quite aware of
your feeling towards me. You are fairly transparent,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
Yelverton, if you don’t mind my saying so!”</p>

<p>“The position was very extraordinary. Humphreys
got Audley out of the way—I will explain that
later—and that, he thought, would leave Thelma
unprotected. But he never expected your interest in
the bride. You became a very unwelcome bit of grit
in a very well-oiled machine. You were constantly
with Thelma, she was never left alone for a moment—and
you were in the way.”</p>

<p>And the shrewd old man smiled mysteriously.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br>

<small>THE SECRET DISCLOSED</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">But</span> what was the mystery of Audley’s disappearance?”
I asked Feng, in breathless eagerness,
now that the enigma was in course of solution.</p>

<p>“Well, Humphreys at first did his level best to
prevent the marriage, but finding that impossible he
went very cleverly to work. Audley, who was a
young man of means—though he pretended that his
profession was that of electrical engineer—had,
Humphreys discovered, fallen into the hands of a
man named Graydon, a friend of his, who lived in
the same house as Audley and who was one of a
gang of note forgers.</p>

<p>“By clever means this gang had used Audley for
their own purposes, even to the extent of sometimes
inducing him to assume Graydon’s identity. Harold
Ruthen was one of Graydon’s accomplices in passing
spurious notes, hence old Humphreys knew of Audley’s
connection with the forgers. After Thelma’s
marriage which he had tried in vain to prevent, it
was highly necessary for the furtherance of Humphreys’
sinister plan, to get her husband away. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
therefore caused to be sent to him at Mürren a
veiled message that the police were making inquiries
in London and that he had better at once efface himself,
even from his wife. This he did, leaving
Thelma in your care.”</p>

<p>“But was Stanley really a forger?” I asked.</p>

<p>“At first I thought so, but later I found that the
poor fellow had acted in all innocence. He was
being blackmailed by the gang and thus forced to
assist them, until he received that warning and fled,”
replied Feng. “I was all the time watching the
very deep game played by the wily old crook who
posed as an invalid. With Audley out of the way
he expected that it would be easy to complete his
plans. Instead, to his great chagrin, you came forward
as the bride’s companion and protector. It
was then that he determined, if you still continued to
watch over the girl, from whose husband he had contrived
to part her, that your activities should be suppressed.
It then became my active duty to keep
guard over both of you, which I did to the best of
my ability.</p>

<p>“It was, of course, a difficult task. Had he been
in New York you would both have been watched
night and day by men of the Thu-tseng. The Chinese
make the finest ‘shadowers’ in the world and in
New York they are so very numerous that I could
employ them with impunity. In London they are too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
conspicuous. It was really through this that Humphreys
nearly beat me at the finish.</p>

<p>“But I will give you an instance of how narrowly
you escaped. Do you remember one night when
we all had supper with Humphreys at a Chinese
restaurant near Piccadilly Circus?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I nodded.</p>

<p>“And you remember that I signalled to you not
to eat the cold soup that was served?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I replied. “I thought you meant it was
something I should not like.”</p>

<p>“You would have been dead in five days if you
had eaten it,” said Feng grimly. “It was by a
miracle of luck that I saw Humphreys drop into it a
tiny pellet as he reached his hand out for some
bread. The Chinese waiter took your soup away.
Humphreys did not notice the Chinese remark I
made to the waiter, but that soup was preserved and
analyzed. It contained a virulent culture of the
germs of typhoid fever. The Chinese waiter, of
course, was an agent of the Thu-tseng. I daresay
you will meet him some day. He happens to be a
doctor and a great friend of mine. He analyzed the
soup for me. If you had taken a spoonful of it
while Humphreys was telling the funny stories at
which you were laughing, you would have been dead
in five days—of perfectly natural causes.”</p>

<p>“But, Thelma. Did you know anything of all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
this?” I asked turning to her, astounded and
muddled.</p>

<p>“Some of the facts I knew, but not all,” she replied.
“I hope you will forgive me, but I acted all
along upon Doctor Feng’s instructions. At Mürren
I knew nothing, and was entirely unsuspicious of the
plot against us both.”</p>

<p>“Humphreys had degenerated into perhaps the
cleverest financial crook in Eastern Europe,” said
Feng. “The way in which he held Audley aloof
from his wife while his friends Graydon and Ruthen
were at the same time terrorizing him and compelling
him to assist in passing their spurious notes, was
a most remarkable feature of the case. He acted
with such caution and pre-arranged things so cunningly,
that I confess I was more than once misled
and befogged.</p>

<p>“It was he who sent you those warnings from
Hammersmith and North London in an endeavor to
frighten you off. He certainly had a sort of superstitious
fear of you. My chief fear for Thelma was
that she might be secretly poisoned in a similar manner
to the attempt upon yourself. Therefore I insisted
that she should never take her meals in a
restaurant alone.”</p>

<p>“And I was in ignorance,” I exclaimed.</p>

<p>“I deemed it best. I did not wish to alarm either
of you, and indeed it is only since the narrow escape<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
you both had at Heathermoor Gardens that I revealed
to Thelma the motive of the plot. I did not
suspect that terrible death-trap, but as soon as
Thelma was missing I naturally felt that she must
have fallen into the hands of one or other of the
gang. Judge my surprise when I discovered that
she surreptitiously, at Audley’s request, rejoined him
in hiding at a small private hotel in Gloucester Road,
Kensington. Audley was in constant dread of the
police, an apprehension kept alive by Ruthen and
Graydon, and for that reason he destroyed his
clothes and some false notes before escaping from
the room at Lancaster Gate. He turned the key
from the outside, in order further to mystify those
whom he believed to be his pursuers.”</p>

<p>“I was his pursuer,” I remarked.</p>

<p>“True. But he was avoiding you, as well as the
police,” Feng said. “He was told that you were
making inquiries concerning him on his wife’s behalf
and would, if you gained the truth, reveal it to her.
Naturally, he had no desire that Thelma should
know that the police were wanting him upon grave
charges of forgery.”</p>

<p>“But why did he not openly defy those men into
whose hands he fell before his marriage?” I asked.
“Surely, he could have cleared himself and have
given information to the police.”</p>

<p>“Ah! Humphreys, the criminal with the master-mind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
took very good care that he was so deeply implicated
that he dare not utter a word,” my friend
pointed out. “Recollect his determination was that
Thelma, alone and without friends except her
mother, should meet with an untimely end in order
that the Sung-tchun fortune should pass to him.</p>

<p>“First, however, she married unexpectedly, and,
secondly, you came upon the scene as her protector.
It was for that reason an attempt was first made to
poison you, and then that clever plot at Stamford
whereby you were drugged by that final cigarette
given you by the supposed commercial traveler, who
afterwards entered your room, forced against your
lips a bottle containing a deadly drug, and made it
appear as though you had committed suicide.
Humphreys believed that you knew too much, so he
intended that you should die before the girl over
whom you were so carefully watching. He had no
idea, however, of the part I was playing—until the
police went to arrest him.”</p>

<p>“But could you not have told me the truth long
ago—and given me warning?” I asked.</p>

<p>“That was impossible,” he replied. “Remember
I warned you repeatedly. You would only have
laughed had I told you Humphreys was your enemy:
you were already deeply prejudiced against me.
Thelma, too, tried to induce you to give the whole
thing up, but you refused. Had Humphreys known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
that you suspected him he would have had you both
murdered out of hand and chanced detection. But
as things were he elected to wait until he could devise
a plot that would be absolutely safe. So long as
Stanley Audley was out of the way there was no need
for him to do anything rash. And by his patience he
nearly won in the end.”</p>

<p>“But he very nearly lost,” I said. “Suppose
Thelma and I had been burnt to death. We could
never have been identified and Humphreys could not
have proved Thelma’s death. That meant he could
not have inherited her fortune at any rate until sufficient
time had elapsed for the Courts to presume
her death.”</p>

<p>“You are a lawyer, Yelverton, and of course that
point would occur to you. But it also occurred to
Humphreys—another instance of his amazing foresight—and
he took steps accordingly. Thelma,
show Mr. Yelverton your locket.”</p>

<p>With a smile Thelma took from her pocket a
heavy locket attached to a chain and handed it to me.
I was astonished at its massiveness and weight, until
I saw both locket and chain were of platinum. On
the front of the locket was deeply engraved the inscription,
“Thelma Audley—from Stanley.”</p>

<p>“Platinum; you see, Yelverton!” said old Feng.</p>

<p>I gasped in astonishment at the realization of
Humphreys’ cleverness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>“Of course,” I said, “it would resist the fire, the
locket would be found in the débris and Thelma’s
disappearance would be explained, in part at any
rate.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” rejoined Feng, “the locket would account
for Thelma and what more natural than the conclusion
that the remains of the man found with her
were those of her husband?”</p>

<p>“But what has become of Stanley?” I asked, wondering
why Thelma was here without him.</p>

<p>“Stanley Audley is dead,” said Feng very gently,
and I noticed the slow tears begin to trickle down
Thelma’s face. “He died like a hero. It was he
who rescued Thelma from the blazing room. By
some extraordinary chance the fire seems to have
spread mainly in your direction and Thelma escaped
with the loss of most of her clothing and her hair
which was almost burnt off. But poor Stanley was
so terribly burned that he died three days later in the
hospital. There is no doubt he loved Thelma deeply
and utterly regretted the trouble he had brought
upon her.”</p>

<p>Stanley Audley dead! I held my breath! Then
Thelma was free! Such was my involuntary
reflection.</p>

<p>Thelma was weeping softly. I hardly dared look
at her. But I put out my hand and clasped hers.
She turned her head away and gazed in silence at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
the golden glow in the west across the sea. But she
did not withdraw her hand and a great wave of joy
flooded through me.</p>

<p>“But how did we escape?” I asked Feng.</p>

<p>“We were only in the nick of time,” he replied.
“When Thelma disappeared from her husband in
Gloucester Road I felt certain that she had been
decoyed away. She was—by a message purporting
to come from her husband asking her to call at
Heathermoor Gardens. She did so and fell into the
hands of the man who intended she should die. Yet
so clever was old Humphreys, that, though I kept
him under close observation, I could not discern that
he was acting at all suspiciously. I did not know of
course, of his plot to burn you alive. But we were
watching him very closely. That night Stanley and
I tracked him to the house at Hampstead. We saw
you arrive later, but we little dreamed that Thelma
was held there a drugged and helpless prisoner.
She screamed twice, apparently, and you heard her,
but some accomplice of Humphreys’ gave her a
hypodermic injection—we found the mark afterwards
on her arm.</p>

<p>“We watched until the first man-servant came out
and later Humphreys himself left the place and
walking in some distance away concealed himself in
full view of the house. Then I knew you were left
in there, and I became seriously alarmed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>“Fortunately a constable was near, and unseen by
the old villain I approached him, told him of my
suspicions, and we all three approached the house together.
To our rings and knocks there was no
answer, therefore we forced the door and rushed in.
As we opened the door of the room where you were,
we saw the air-ball burst and in a second the room
was a furnace.</p>

<p>“Then came a desperate fight for life. Audley
dashed to Thelma and succeeded in getting her out
into the street at the cost of his own life, while I
and the constable cut the rope which secured your
wrists, and carried you out terribly burned and insensible.
Both the constable and I were also burned,
but not very seriously. Before the fire brigade arrived
the house had been seriously damaged: but for
our early warning it must have been utterly destroyed,
as Humphreys intended.</p>

<p>“Meanwhile, Humphreys, who had seen the failure
of his plot, made himself scarce and it was not until
three days later that Inspector Cayley of Scotland
Yard, with two sergeants traced him to a room in
Earl’s Court Road, where he was hiding. But the
old criminal had locked himself in and before they
could break open the door he had put a bullet
through his brain. A week ago both Ruthen and
Graydon were arrested at the Pavilion Hotel in
Boulogne on charges of passing spurious notes in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
various towns in France. They will, no doubt, go to
hard labor for some years.”</p>

<p>“Well, Yelverton,” the old man concluded, “I
think you know everything now. You have both had
a very narrow escape from a terrible fate. Only a
devil in human form could have devised such an
atrocity. But now I’ll leave you alone for a bit:
you will have plenty to talk about.”</p>

<p>And with a cheery smile and a loving look at
Thelma, the sturdy, bearded old man, to whose
watchfulness we both owed our lives, turned on his
heel and left the room.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The calm Riviera sunset had deepened into twilight,
swiftly as it always does, and the night clouds
rising over the pine-clad Esterels cast their long grey
shadows across the calm sea. Beneath our window
twinkling lights shone and from among the orange
graves below came voices and merry laughter.</p>

<p>I had been speaking earnestly to Thelma—pleading
with her all the fervor of the love I had so long
held in restraint but which, now she was free, poured
out with violence that overwhelmed me. She heard
me without comment or response. But she made no
protest, she allowed me to hold her hand, even when
I pressed it tenderly to my lips she did not withdraw
it.</p>

<p>The hope that had never quite died rose again in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
my heart. I felt Thelma trembling; a beautiful
warmth that I had never seen before glowed upon
her cheeks, her eyes were lustrous with the brilliancy
of tears which welled up into them but did not fall.
She stood looking out across the broad Mediterranean
towards the African coast which the colors
of the sunset paled into the faint splendor of the
afterglow.</p>

<p>The light was nearly gone, and still she made no
sign. But presently words failed me and I simply
stood and held out my arms in a last despairing
appeal.</p>

<p>Then my darling came to me, slowly and sweetly,
her great grey eyes aflame with a light I had never
seen before. And our lips met at last.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>We were married in October and spent our honeymoon
in Seville and Malaga. Christmas found us
at the Hotel Regina at Wengen, a little below
Mürren, where we both went skiing daily. We
visited Mürren, of course, hallowed to us for all
time as the place of that strange first meeting from
which all our troubles and all our happiness had
sprung.</p>

<p>We are rich, of course, Sung-tchun’s fortune was
enormous. But we live very quietly in my old home—my
father’s quaint, old-world cottage on the Salisbury
road a few miles from Andover. Most of our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
income, apart from our own modest wants, goes to
help the slum children of London. Thelma never
tires of them and every summer forms a big camp to
which hundreds come down for a few days’ glorious
holiday. They all seem to worship her and over
even the roughest of them she seems to exercise a
magical fascination.</p>

<p>Old Doctor Feng, to whom we owe so much, is
our chief friend. He comes and goes as he pleases.
There is a room reserved for him and always ready.
Devoted to Thelma, he spends much of his time
with us. He never tires of talking of the Crystal
Claw, the magic talisman that saved us for each
other. And every now and again, with his inimitable
chuckle, he croaks out, “Yelverton, I told you the
arm of the Thu-tseng was long!”</p>

<p>It was long indeed. It stretched half across the
world to give us—two tiny units caught in a cruel
trap—a helping hand in our dire distress. We owe
our wealth, our radiant happiness, our very lives to
the magical influence of the Crystal Claw.</p>
